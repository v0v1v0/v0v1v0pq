<h2>
Reading different versions of linguistic multialignments.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multialignments of strings are a central step for historical linguistics (quite similar to multialignments in bioinformatics). There is no consensus (yet) about the file-structure for multialignments in linguistics. Currently, this functions offers to read various flavours of multialignment, trying to harmonize the internal R-structure.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_align(file, flavor)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>

<p>Multialignment to be read
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flavor</code></td>
<td>

<p>Currently two flavours are implemented <code>"PAD"</code> and <code>"BDPA"</code>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The flavor <code>"PAD"</code> refers to the Phonetische Atlas Deutschlands, which provides multialignments for german dialects. The flavor <code>"BDPA"</code> refers to the Benchmark Database for Phonetic Alignments.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Multialignment-files often contain various different kinds of information. An attempt is made to turn the data into a list with the following elements:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>meta</code></td>
<td>
<p>: Metadata</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>align</code></td>
<td>
<p>: The actual alignments as a dataframe. When IDs are present in the original file, they are used as rownames. Some attempt is made to add useful column names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>doculects</code></td>
<td>
<p>: The rows of the alignment normally are some kind of doculects ("languages", "dialects"). However, because these doculects might occur more than once (when two different, but cognate words from a languages are included) these names are not used as rownames of <code>$align</code>, but presented separately here.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>annotations</code></td>
<td>
<p>: The columns of a multialignment can have annotations, e.g. metathesis or orthographic standard. These annotations are saved here as a dataframe with the same number of columns as the <code>$align</code> dataframe. The name of the annotation is put in the rownames.</p>
</td>
</tr>
