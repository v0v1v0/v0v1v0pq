<h2>Find Cutoff Values.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>findCutoffs</code> applies a quantile adjustment to inspection scores within a
jurisdiction's subunits (e.g. ZIP codes) and creates a data frame of cutoff
values to be used for grading restaurants or other inspected entities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">findCutoffs(X, z, gamma, resolve.ties = TRUE, restaurant.tol = 10,
  max.iterations = 20)
</code></pre>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric matrix of size <code>n</code> x <code>p</code>, where <code>n</code> is the
number is restaurants to be graded and <code>p</code> is the number of inspections
to be used in grade assignment.  Entry  <code>X[i,j]</code> represents the

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In our documentation, we use the language "ZIP code" and "restaurant",
however, our grading algorithm and our code can be applied to grade other
inspected entities; and quantile cutoffs can be sought in subunits of a
jurisdiction that are not ZIP codes. For example, it may make sense to search
for quantile cutoffs in an inspector's allocated inspection area or within a
census tract. We chose to work with ZIP codes in our work because area
assignments for inspectors in King County (WA) tend to be single or multiple
ZIP codes, and we desired to assign grades based on how a restaurant's scores
compare to other restaurants assessed by the same inspector.  We could have
calculated quantile cutoffs in an inspector's allocated area, but inspector
areas are not always contiguous. Because food choices are generally local, ZIP
codes offer a transparent and meaningful basis for consumers to distinguish
establishments. Where "ZIP code" is referenced, please read "ZIP code or other
subunit of a jurisdiction" and "restaurant" should read "restaurant or other
entity to be graded".
</p>
<p><code>findCutoffs</code> takes in a vector of cutoff scores, <code>gamma</code>, a matrix
of restaurants' scores, <code>X</code>, and a vector corresponding to restaurants'
ZIP codes, <code>z</code>, and outputs a data frame of cutoff scores to be used in
the <code>gradeAllBus</code> function to assign grades to restaurants.
<code>findCutoffs</code> first carries out "unadjusted grading" and compares
restaurants' most recent routine inspection scores to the raw cutoff scores
contained in <code>gamma</code> and assigns initial grades to restaurants. Grade
proportions in this scheme are then used as initial quantiles to find quantile
cutoffs in each ZIP code (or quantile cutoffs accommodating for the presence
of score ties in the ZIP code, depending on the value of <code>resolve.ties</code>;
see the Modes section). Restaurants are then graded with the ZIP code quantile
cutoffs, and grading proportions are compared with grading proportions from
the unadjusted system. Quantiles are iterated over one at a time (by the
internal <code>percentileSeek</code> function, which uses a binary search root
finding method) until grading proportions with ZIP code quantile cutoffs are
within a certain tolerance (as determined by <code>restaurant.tol</code>) of the
unadjusted grading proportions. This iterative step is important because of the
discrete nature of the inspection score distribution, and the existence of
large numbers of restaurants with the same inspection scores.
</p>
<p>The returned ZIP code cutoff data frame has one row for each unique ZIP code
and has <code>(length(gamma)+1)</code> columns, corresponding to one column for the
ZIP code name, and <code>(length(gamma))</code> cutoff scores separating the
<code>(length(gamma)+1)</code> grading categories.  Across each ZIP code's row,
cutoff scores increase and we assume, as in the King County (WA) case, that
greater risk is associated with larger inspection scores. (If scores are
decreasing in risk, users should transform inspection scores  with a simple
function such as <code>f(score) = - score</code> before using any of the functions
in <code>QuantileGradeR</code>.)
</p>


<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>When <code>resolve.ties = TRUE</code>, in order to calculate
quantile cutoffs in a ZIP code, we alter the definition of quantile from
the usual "Nearest Rank" definition and use the "Quantile Adjustment (with
Ties Resolution)" definition that is discussed in Appendix J of
Ho, D.E., Ashwood, Z.C., and Elias, B. "Improving the Reliability of Food
Safety Disclosure: A Quantile Adjusted Restaurant Grading System for
Seattle-King County" (working paper). In particular, once we have found the
optimal set of quantiles to be applied across ZIP codes, <code>p</code>,
with the <code>percentileSeek</code> function, instead of returning (for B/C
cutoffs, for example) the scores in each ZIP code that result in <em>at
least</em> (<code>p[2]</code> x 100)% of restaurants in the ZIP code scoring
less than or equal to these cutoffs, the mode <code>resolve.ties = TRUE</code>
takes into account the ties that exist in ZIP codes. Returned scores for
A/B cutoffs are those that result in the <em>closest</em> percentage of
restaurants in the ZIP code scoring less than or equal to the A/B cutoff to
the desired percentage, (<code>p[1]</code> x 100)%. Similarly, B/C cutoffs
are the scores in the ZIP code that result in the <em>closest</em> percentage
of restaurants in the ZIP code scoring less than or equal to the B/C cutoff
and more than the A/B cutoff to the desired percentage, (<code>(p[2] -
  p[1])</code> x 100)%.
</p>
<p>When <code>resolve.ties = FALSE</code>, we use the usual "Nearest
Rank" definition of quantile when applying the optimal quantiles,
<code>p</code>, across ZIP codes.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><code>findCutoffs</code> will produce cutoff scores even for ZIP
codes with only one restaurant: situations in which a quantile adjustment
shouldn't be used. It is the job of the user to ensure that, if using the
<code>findCutoffs</code> function, it makes sense to do so.  This may involve only
performing the quantile adjustment on larger ZIP codes and providing
absolute cutoff points for smaller ZIP codes, or may involve aggregating
smaller ZIP codes into a larger geographical unit and then performing the
quantile adjustment on the larger area (the latter approach is the one we
adopted).
</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, <code>findCutoffs</code> was created for
an inspection system that associates greater risk with larger inspection
scores. If the inspection system of interest associates greater risk with
reduced scores, it will be neccessary to perform a transformation of the
scores matrix before utilizing the <code>findCutoffs</code> function. However a
simple function such as <code>f(score) = - score</code> would perform the
necessary transformation.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## ==== Quantile-Adjusted Grading =====
## ZIP Code Cutoffs
# In King County, meaningful scores in the inspection system are 0 and 30:
# more than 50% of restaurants score 0 points in a single inspection round,
# and 30 is the highest score that a restaurant can be assigned before it is
# subject to a return inspection, hence these values form our gamma vector.
# The output dataframe, zipcode.cutoffs.df, has ten rows and three columns: one
# row for every unique ZIP code in zips.kc, one column for the ZIP name, the
# second column for the A/B cutoff (Gamma.A) and the third column for the B/C
# cutoff (Gamma.B).

 zipcode.cutoffs.df &lt;- findCutoffs(X.kc, zips.kc, gamma = c(0, 30))

## ==== Traditional Grading Systems ====
## ZIP Code Cutoffs
# Traditional (unadjusted) restaurant grading systems use the same cutoff scores
# for all ZIP codes. To allow comparison, an unadjusted ZIP code cutoff frame
# for King County is generated by the internal createCutoffsDF function:

 unadj.cutoffs.df &lt;- createCutoffsDF(X.kc, zips.kc, gamma = c(0, 30), type = "unadj")
