<h2>Unit weights implied by matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>matching_weights</code> derives the weights implied by a matching for units
assigned to matched groups. If the matching is exact, reweighting the units
with this function will produce a sample where all treatment groups are
identical on the matching covariates. If the matching is approximate but of
good quality, the reweighted treatment groups will be close to identical.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matching_weights(treatments, matching, target = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatments</code></td>
<td>
<p>factor specifying the units' treatment assignments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matching</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>qm_matching</code> or <code>scclust</code> object with
the matched groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target</code></td>
<td>
<p>units to target the weights for. If <code>NULL</code>, the weights will target
all units, so that the reweighted treatment groups are as similar as
possible to the complete sample (i.e., corresponding to ATE). A non-null
value specifies a subset of units that the weights should be targeted for
(e.g., ATT or ATC). If <code>target</code> is a logical vector with the same
length as the sample size, units indicated with <code>TRUE</code> will be
targeted. If <code>target</code> is an integer vector, the units with indices
in <code>target</code> are targeted. If <code>target</code> is a character vector, it
should contain treatment labels, and the weights target the corresponding
units (as given by <code>treatments</code>).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let <code class="reqn">S(g)</code> be the number of units indicated by <code>target</code> in group
<code class="reqn">g</code> (or the total number of units in the group if <code>target</code> is
<code>NULL</code>). Let <code class="reqn">T</code> be the total number of units indicated by
<code>target</code> in the sample (or the sample size if <code>target</code> is <code>NULL</code>).
Let <code class="reqn">A(t, g)</code> be the number of units assigned to treatment <code class="reqn">t</code> in
group <code class="reqn">g</code>. The weight for a unit in group <code class="reqn">g</code> that is assigned to
treatment <code class="reqn">t</code> is given by:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{S(g)}{T \times A(t, g)}.</code>
</p>

<p>Consider, for example, a matched group with one treated unit and two control
units when we are interested in the average effect of the treated (ATT) and
we have 50 treated units in total (<code class="reqn">T=50</code>). For all three units in the
group, we have <code class="reqn">S(g)=1</code>. For the treated unit we have <code class="reqn">A(t, g)=1</code>,
so its weight becomes <code class="reqn">1/50</code>. The two control units have <code class="reqn">A(t, g)=2</code>,
so their weights are both <code class="reqn">1/100</code>.
</p>
<p>These weights are such that the difference between the weighted averages of
the outcomes in two treatment conditions is the same as the average
within-group difference-in-means between the two conditions.
</p>
<p>If a matched group <code class="reqn">g</code> with <code class="reqn">S(g) &gt; 0</code> lacks some treatment condition
<code class="reqn">t</code>, no weights exist for the units assigned to <code class="reqn">t</code> (in other groups)
so to replicate group <code class="reqn">g</code>; the matching does not contain enough
information to impute the missing treatment in group <code class="reqn">g</code>. Subsequently,
all units assigned to <code class="reqn">t</code> will be given the weight <code>NA</code>. There is
two ways to solve this problem. First, one can change the target estimand by
setting <code class="reqn">S(g) = 0</code> for all groups that are missing units assigned to
<code class="reqn">t</code>. This is done with the <code>target</code> parameter. Second, one can change
the matching so that all groups contain at least one unit assigned to <code class="reqn">t</code>
(e.g., by merging groups).
</p>
<p>Units not assigned to matched groups are given zero weights.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a numeric vector with the weights of the units in the matching.
