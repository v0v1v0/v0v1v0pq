<h2>Recode Unique Values in a Character Vector to 0ther (or NA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>recode2other</code> recodes multiple unique values in a character vector to
the same new value (e.g., "other", NA_character_). It's primary use is to
recode based on the minimum frequency of the unique values so that low
frequency values can be combined into the same category; however, it also
allows for recoding particular unique values given by the user (see details).
This function is a wrapper for <code>car::recode</code>, which can handle general
recoding of character vectors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">recode2other(
  x,
  freq.min,
  prop = FALSE,
  inclusive = TRUE,
  other.nm = "other",
  extra.nm = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector. If not a character vector, it will be coarced to
one via <code>as.character</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq.min</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of length 1 specifying the minimum frequency
of a unique value to keep it unchanged and consequentially recode any
unique values with frequencues less than (or equal to) it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prop</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying if <code>freq.min</code> provides
the frequency as a count (FALSE) or proportion (TRUE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inclusive</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying whether the frequency
of a unique value exactly equal to <code>freq.min</code> should be kept unchanged
(and not recoded to <code>other.nm</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>other.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1 specifying what value the other
unique values should be recoded to. This can be NA_character_ resulting in
recoding to a missing value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extra.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector specifying extra unique values that should
be recoded to <code>other.nm</code> that are not included based on the minimum
frequency from the combination of <code>freq.min</code>, <code>prop</code>,
<code>inclusive</code>. The default is NULL, meaning no extra unique values are
recoded.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>extra.nm</code> argument allows for <code>recode2other</code> to be used as
simpler function that just recodes particular unique values to the same new
value (although arguably this is easier to do using <code>car::recode</code>
directly). To do so set <code>freq.min = 0</code> and provide the unique values to
<code>extra.nm</code>. Note, that the current version of this function does not
allow for NA_character_ to be included in <code>extra.nm</code> as it will end up
treating it as "NA" (see examples).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>character vector of the same length as <code>x</code> with unique values
with frequency less than <code>freq.nm</code> recoded to <code>other.nm</code> as well
as any unique values in <code>extra.nm</code>. While the current version of the
function allows for recoding *to* NA values via <code>other.nm</code>, it does
not allow for recoding *from* NA values via <code>extra.nm</code> (see examples).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# based on minimum frequency unique values
state_region &lt;- as.character(state.region)
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 13) # freq.min as a count
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 0.26, prop = TRUE) # freq.min as a proportion
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 13, other.nm = "_blank_")
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 13,
   other.nm = NA) # allows for other.nm to be NA
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 13,
   extra.nm = "South") # add an extra unique value to recode
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 13,
   inclusive = FALSE) # recodes "West" to "other"

# based on user given unique values
recode2other(state_region, freq.min = 0,
   extra.nm = c("South","West")) # recodes manually rather than by freq.min
# current version does NOT allow for NA to be a unique value that is converted to other
state_region2 &lt;- c(NA, state_region, NA)
recode2other(state_region2, freq.min = 13) # NA remains in the character vector
recode2other(state_region2, freq.min = 0,
   extra.nm = c("South","West",NA)) # NA remains in the character vector
