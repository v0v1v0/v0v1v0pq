<h2>Create a feature co-occurrence matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a sparse feature co-occurrence matrix, measuring co-occurrences of
features within a user-defined context. The context can be defined as a
document or a window within a collection of documents, with an optional
vector of weights applied to the co-occurrence counts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fcm(
  x,
  context = c("document", "window"),
  count = c("frequency", "boolean", "weighted"),
  window = 5L,
  weights = NULL,
  ordered = FALSE,
  tri = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a tokens, or dfm object from which to generate the feature
co-occurrence matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>context</code></td>
<td>
<p>the context in which to consider term co-occurrence:
<code>"document"</code> for co-occurrence counts within document; <code>"window"</code>
for co-occurrence within a defined window of words, which requires a
positive integer value for <code>window</code>.  Note: if <code>x</code> is a dfm
object, then <code>context</code> can only be <code>"document"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>count</code></td>
<td>
<p>how to count co-occurrences:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"frequency"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>count the number of co-occurrences within the
context</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"boolean"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>count only the co-occurrence or not within the
context, irrespective of how many times it occurs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"weighted"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>count a weighted function of counts, typically as
a function of distance from the target feature.  Only makes sense for
<code>context = "window"</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>positive integer value for the size of a window on either side
of the target feature, default is 5, meaning 5 words before and after the
target feature</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of weights applied to each distance from
<code>1:window</code>, strictly decreasing by default; can be a custom-defined
vector of the same length as <code>window</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ordered</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, count only the forward co-occurrences for each
target token for bigram models, so that the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠i, j⁠</code> cell of the fcm is the
number of times that token <code>j</code> occurs before the target token <code>i</code> within
the window. Only makes sense for <code>context = "window"</code>, and when <code>ordered = TRUE</code>, the argument <code>tri</code> has no effect.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tri</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code> return only upper triangle (including diagonal).
Ignored if <code>ordered = TRUE</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>fcm()</code> provides a very general
implementation of a "context-feature" matrix, consisting of a count of
feature co-occurrence within a defined context.  This context, following
Momtazi et. al. (2010), can be defined as the <em>document</em>,
<em>sentences</em> within documents, <em>syntactic relationships</em> between
features (nouns within a sentence, for instance), or according to a
<em>window</em>.  When the context is a window, a weighting function is
typically applied that is a function of distance from the target word (see
Jurafsky and Martin 2015, Ch. 16) and ordered co-occurrence of the two
features is considered (see Church &amp; Hanks 1990).
</p>
<p>fcm provides all of this functionality, returning a <code class="reqn">V * V</code>
matrix (where <code class="reqn">V</code> is the vocabulary size, returned by
<code>nfeat()</code>). The <code>tri = TRUE</code> option will only return the
upper part of the matrix.
</p>
<p>Unlike some implementations of co-occurrences, fcm counts feature
co-occurrences with themselves, meaning that the diagonal will not be zero.
</p>
<p>fcm also provides "boolean" counting within the context of "window",
which differs from the counting within "document".
</p>
<p><code>is.fcm(x)</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> if and only if its x is an object of
type fcm.
