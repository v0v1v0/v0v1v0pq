<h2>Combine dfm objects by Rows or Columns</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Combine a dfm with another dfm, or numeric, or matrix object,
returning a dfm with the combined documents or features, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'dfm'
cbind(...)

## S3 method for class 'dfm'
rbind(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>dfm, numeric, or matrix  objects to be joined column-wise
(<code>cbind</code>) or row-wise (<code>rbind</code>) to the first.  Numeric objects
not confirming to the row or column dimension will be recycled as normal.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>cbind(x, y, ...)</code> combines dfm objects by columns, returning a
dfm object with combined features from input dfm objects.  Note that this
should be used with extreme caution, as joining dfms with different
documents will result in a new row with the docname(s) of the first dfm,
merging in those from the second.  Furthermore, if features are shared
between the dfms being cbinded, then duplicate feature labels will result.
In both instances, warning messages will result.
</p>
<p><code>rbind(x, y, ...)</code> combines dfm objects by rows, returning a
dfm object with combined features from input dfm objects.  Features are
matched between the two dfm objects, so that the order and names of the
features do not need to match.  The order of the features in the resulting
dfm is not guaranteed.  The attributes and settings of this new dfm are not
currently preserved.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># cbind() for dfm objects
(dfmat1 &lt;- dfm(tokens(c("a b c d", "c d e f"))))
(dfmat2 &lt;- dfm(tokens(c("a b", "x y z"))))
cbind(dfmat1, dfmat2)
cbind(dfmat1, 100)
cbind(100, dfmat1)
cbind(dfmat1, matrix(c(101, 102), ncol = 1))
cbind(matrix(c(101, 102), ncol = 1), dfmat1)


# rbind() for dfm objects
(dfmat1 &lt;- dfm(tokens(c(doc1 = "This is one sample text sample."))))
(dfmat2 &lt;- dfm(tokens(c(doc2 = "One two three text text."))))
(dfmat3 &lt;- dfm(tokens(c(doc3 = "This is the fourth sample text."))))
rbind(dfmat1, dfmat2)
rbind(dfmat1, dfmat2, dfmat3)
