<h2>Derive generalized full matchings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>quickmatch</code> constructs near-optimal generalized full matchings. The
function expects the user to provide distances measuring the similarity of
units and a set of matching constraints. It then constructs a matching
so that units assigned to the same group are as similar as possible while
satisfying the matching constraints.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">quickmatch(
  distances,
  treatments,
  treatment_constraints = NULL,
  size_constraint = NULL,
  target = NULL,
  caliper = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distances</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>distances</code> object or a numeric vector, matrix
or data frame. The parameter describes the similarity of the units to be
matched. It can either be preprocessed distance information using a
<code>distances</code> object, or raw covariate data. When
called with covariate data, Euclidean distances are calculated unless
otherwise specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatments</code></td>
<td>
<p>factor specifying the units' treatment assignments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment_constraints</code></td>
<td>
<p>named integer vector with the treatment constraints. If <code>NULL</code>, the
function ensures that each matched group contains one unit from each
treatment condition.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>size_constraint</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer with the required total number of units in each group. Must be
greater or equal to the sum of <code>treatment_constraints</code>. If NULL, no
constraints other than the treatment constraints are imposed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target</code></td>
<td>
<p>units to target the matching for. All units indicated by <code>target</code> are
ensured to be assigned to a matched group (disregarding eventual
<code>caliper</code> setting). Units not indicated by <code>target</code> could be
left unassigned if they are not necessary to satisfy the matching
constraints. If <code>NULL</code>, <code>quickmatch</code> targets the complete sample
and ensures that all units are assigned to a group. If <code>target</code> is a
logical vector with the same length as the sample size, units indicated
with <code>TRUE</code> will be targeted. If <code>target</code> is an integer vector,
the units with indices in <code>target</code> are targeted. Indices starts at 1
and <code>target</code> must be sorted. If <code>target</code> is a character vector,
it should contain treatment labels, and the corresponding units (as given
by <code>treatments</code>) will be targeted.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>treatment_constraints</code> parameter should be a named vector with
treatment-specific constraints. For example, in a sample with treatment
conditions "A", "B" and "C", the vector <code>c("A" = 1, "B" = 2, "C" = 0)</code>
specifies that each matched group should contain at least one unit with
treatment "A", at least two units with treatment "B" and any number of units
with treatment "C". Treatments not specified in the vector defaults to zero.
For example, the vector <code>c("A" = 1, "B" = 2)</code> is identical to the
previous one. When <code>treatment_constraints</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the function
requires at least one unit for each treatment in each group. In our current
example, <code>NULL</code> would be shorthand for <code>c("A" = 1, "B" = 1, "C" = 1)</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>size_constraint</code> parameter can be used to constrain the matched
groups to contain at least a certain number of units in total (independently
of treatment assignment). For example, if <code>treatment_constraints =
c("A" = 1, "B" = 2)</code> and <code>total_size_constraint = 4</code>, each matched
group will contain at least one unit assigned to "A", at least two units
assigned to "B" and at least four units in total, where the fourth unit can
be from any treatment condition.
</p>
<p>The <code>target</code> parameter can be used to control which units are included
in the matching. When <code>target</code> is <code>NULL</code> (the default), all units
will be assigned to a matched group. When not <code>NULL</code>, the parameter
indicates that some units must be assigned to matched group and that the
remaining units can safely be ignored. This can be useful, for example,
when one is interested in estimating treatment effects only for a certain
type of units (e.g., the average treatment effect for the treated, ATT). It
is particularly useful when units of interested are not represented in the
whole covariate space (i.e., an one-sided overlap problem). Without the
<code>target</code> parameter, the function would in such cases try to assign every
unit to a group, including units in sparse regions that we are not interested
in. This could lead to unnecessarily large and diverse matched groups. By
specifying that some units are of interest only insofar as they help us satisfy
the matching constraints (i.e., setting the <code>target</code> parameter to the
appropriate value), we can avoid such situations.
</p>
<p>Consider, as an example, a study with two treatment conditions, "A" and "B".
Units assigned to "B" are more numerous and tend to have more extreme
covariate values. We are, however, only interested in estimating the
treatment effect for units assigned to "A". By specifying <code>target = "A"</code>,
the function ensures that all "A" units are assigned to matched groups. Some
units assigned to treatment "B" – in particular the units with extreme
covariate values – will be left unassigned. However, as those units are not
of interest, they can safely be ignored, and we avoid groups of poor quality.
</p>
<p>Even if some of the units that can be ignored are not needed to satisfy the
matching constraints, it is rarely beneficial to discard them blindly; they can
occasionally provide useful information. The default behavior when <code>target</code>
is non-NULL is to assign as many of the ignorable units as possible given that
the within-group distances do not increase too much
(using <code>secondary_unassigned_method = "estimated_radius"</code>). This behavior
might, however, reduce covariate balance in some instances. If called with
<code>secondary_unassigned_method = "ignore"</code>, units not specified in
<code>target</code> will be discarded unless they are absolutely needed to satisfying
the matching constraints. This tends to reduce bias since the within-group
distances are minimized, but it could increase variance since we ignore
potentially useful information in the sample. An intermediate alternative
is to specify an aggressive caliper for the ignorable units, which is done
with the <code>secondary_radius</code> parameter. (These parameters are part of the
<code>sc_clustering</code> function that <code>quickmatch</code> calls.
The <code>target</code> parameter corresponds to the <code>primary_data_points</code>
parameter in that function.)
</p>
<p>The <code>caliper</code> parameter constrains the maximum distance between units
assigned to the same matched group. This is implemented by restricting the
edge weight in the graph used to construct the matched groups (see
<code>sc_clustering</code> for details). As a result, the caliper
will affect all groups in the matching and, in general, make it harder for
the function to find good matches even for groups where the caliper is not
binding. In particular, a too tight <code>caliper</code> can lead to discarded
units that otherwise would be assigned to a group satisfying both the
matching constraints and the caliper. For this reason, it is recommended
to set the <code>caliper</code> value quite high and only use it to avoid particularly
poor matches. It strongly recommended to use the <code>caliper</code> parameter only
when <code>primary_unassigned_method = "closest_seed"</code> in the underlying
<code>sc_clustering</code> function (which is the default
behavior).
</p>
<p><code>quickmatch</code> calls <code>sc_clustering</code> with
<code>seed_method = "inwards_updating"</code>. The <code>seed_method</code> parameter
governs how the seeds are selected in the nearest neighborhood graph that
is used to construct the matched groups (see <code>sc_clustering</code>
for details). The <code>"inwards_updating"</code> option generally works well
and is safe with most datasets. Using <code>seed_method = "exclusion_updating"</code>
often leads to better performance (in the sense of matched groups with more
similar units), but it may increase run time. Discrete data (or more generally
when units tend to be at equal distance to many other units) will lead to
particularly poor run time with this option. If the data set has at least one
continuous covariate, <code>"exclusion_updating"</code> is typically reasonably
quick. A third option is <code>seed_method = "lexical"</code>, which decreases the
run time relative to <code>"inwards_updating"</code> (sometimes considerably) at
the cost of performance. <code>quickmatch</code> passes parameters on to
<code>sc_clustering</code>, so to change <code>seed_method</code>, call
<code>quickmatch</code> with the parameter specified as usual:
<code>quickmatch(..., seed_method = "exclusion_updating")</code>.
