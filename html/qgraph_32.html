<h2>qgraph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the main function of qgraph which automatically creates an appropriate network and sends it to the plotting method.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qgraph( input, ... )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input</code></td>
<td>
<p>Can be either a weights matrix or an edgelist. Can also be an object of class "sem" (sem), "mod" (sem), "lavaan" (lavaan), "principal" (psych), "loadings" (stats), "factanal" (stats), "graphNEL" (Rgraphviz), "pcAlgo" (pcalg),  <code>"huge"</code> (huge), <code>"select"</code> (huge) or the output of <code>glasso</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any additional arguments described below. Also a list with class "qgraph" can be added that contains any of these arguments (this is returned invisibly by the function)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Because of the amount of arguments the usage of the qgraph function has been reduced by using the ... method for clarity. This does mean that arguments need to be specified by using their exact name. For instance, to specify color="red" you can not use col="red".
</p>
<p>Important to note is that qgraph needs to compute in many graphs where the border of nodes are in the plotting area. If the graph is manually rescaled (such as through the "zoom" option in RStudio) the plotting area is changed. This means that the computed location of the border of nodes is no longer valid if the nodes are to remain perfectly square or circular. To overcome this, the <code>usePCH</code> argument can be used. If this argument is set to <code>FALSE</code> nodes will be plotted as polygons meaning they will rescale with rescaling the graph (circles can become ovals) and not have perfect resolution in PDF files. If <code>usePCH</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> a default plotting symbol is used meaning the graph can not be rescaled but the node will look good in PDF. By defaut, <code>qgraph</code> sets <code>usePCH</code> to <code>TRUE</code> if it detects the graph is stored in a file. 
</p>
<p>While the <code>usePCH</code> argument makes graphs rescalable it is not a perfect solution. It is highly recommended to NOT RESCALE PLOTTING AREAS when using qgraph, or to rerun qgraph after the plotting area is rescaled. This means using save graph option fro RStudio shoud be avoided in favor of the <code>filetype</code> argument in <code>qgraph</code>
</p>

<h3>Important additional arguments</h3>

	

<dl>
<dt>layout</dt>
<dd>
<p>This argument controls the layout of the graph. "circle" places all nodes in a single circle, "groups" gives a circular layout in which each group is put in separate circles and "spring" gives a force embedded layout. It also can be a matrix with a row for each node and x and y coordinates in the first and second column respectively. Defaults to "circular" in weighted graphs without a groups list, "groups" in weighted graphs with a groups list, and "spring" in unweighted graphs. Can also be a function from the igraph package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>groups</dt>
<dd>
<p>An object that indicates which nodes belong together. Can be a list in which each element is a vector of integers identifying the numbers of the nodes that belong together, or a factor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>minimum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Edges with absolute weights under this value are not shown (but not omitted). Defaults to 0. Can also be set to <code>"sig"</code> to only show significant edges for <code>graph = "cor"</code> and <code>graph = "pcor"</code>).  Significance level is controlled by <code>alpha</code> and <code>bonf</code> arguments</p>
</dd>
<dt>maximum</dt>
<dd>
<p>qgraph regards the highest of the maximum or highest absolute edge weight as the highest weight to scale the edge widths too. To compare several graphs, set this argument to a higher value than any edge weight in the graphs (typically 1 for correlations).</p>
</dd>
<dt>cut</dt>
<dd>
<p>In weighted graphs, this argument can be used to cut the scaling of edges in width and color saturation. Edges with absolute weights over this value will have the strongest color intensity and become wider the stronger they are, and edges with absolute weights under this value will have the smallest width and become vaguer the weaker the weight. If this is set to <code>0</code>, no cutoff is used and all edges vary in width and color. Defaults to 0 for graphs with less then 20 nodes. For larger graphs the <code>cut</code> value is automatically chosen to be equal to the maximum of the 75th quantile of absolute edge strengths or the edge strength corresponding to 2n-th edge strength (n being the number of nodes.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>details</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical indicating if minimum, maximum and cutoff score should be printed under the graph. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</dd>
<dt>threshold</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric value that defaults to 0. Edges with absolute weight that are not above this value are REMOVED from the network. This differs from <code>minimum</code> which simply changes the scaling of width and color so that edges with absolute weight under minimum are not plotted/invisible. Setting a threshold influences the spring layout and centrality measures obtained with the graph whereass setting a minimum does not. In the case of correlation (<code>graph = "cor"</code>) or partial correlation (<code>graph = "pcor"</code>) networks this argument can also be given a string to omit insignificant edges. See description of this argumet in the next section (Additional options for correlation/covariance matrices).</p>
</dd>
<dt>palette</dt>
<dd>
<p>The palette used for coloring nodes when the <code>groups</code> argument is used. Can be one of <code>"rainbow"</code> (default), <code>"colorblind"</code> (making use of http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/), <code>"pastel"</code>, <code>"gray"</code>, <code>"R"</code> and <code>"ggplot2"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>theme</dt>
<dd>
<p>This argument sets different defaults for various graphical arguments (most notably <code>posCol</code>, <code>negCol</code> and <code>palette</code>). Can be <code>"classic"</code>, <code>"colorblind"</code>, <code>"gray"</code>, <code>"Hollywood"</code>, <code>"Borkulo"</code>, <code>"gimme"</code>, <code>"TeamFortress"</code>, <code>"Reddit"</code>, <code>"Leuven"</code> or <code>"Fried"</code>.</p>

</dl>
<h3>Additional options for correlation/covariance matrices</h3>


<dl>
<dt>graph</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of graph to be made when a correlation or covariance matrix is used as input. Setting this to other values than 
<code>"default"</code> will check if the matrix is a correlation or covariance matrix; if the matrix is not positive definite <code>nearPD</code> from the Matrix package will be used. Options are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"cor"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Plots a correlation network. Runs <code>cov2cor</code> if input is detected to be a covariance matrix and plots the input as is</p>
</dd>
<dt>"pcor"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Plots a partial correlation network, using <code>cor2pcor</code> from the parcor package (Kraemer, Schaefer and Boulesteix, 2009) on the input matrix</p>
</dd>
<dt>"glasso"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Will run <code>EBICglasso</code> to obtain an optimal sparse estimate of the partial correlation matrix using the glasso package (Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani, 2011)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Outdated and limited supported options are <code>"factorial"</code>, which will create a graph based on an exploratory factor analysis, and <code>"sig"</code> will transform all correlations in p-values (using the fdrtool package; Korbinian Strimmer, 2014) and force mode="sig". "sig2" will do the same but show p-values based on negative statistics in shades of orange</p>
</dd>
<dt>threshold</dt>
<dd>
<p>In addition to a numeric value to omit edges this argument can also be assigned a string to omit insignficant edges. Note that this REMOVES edges from the network (which influences centrality measures and the spring layout). Can be <code>"sig"</code> to compute significance without correction for multiple testing, <code>"holm"</code>, <code>"hochberg"</code>, <code>"hommel"</code>, <code>"bonferroni"</code>, <code>"BH"</code>, <code>"BY"</code>, <code>"fdr"</code> or <code>"none"</code> which are used directly in the <code>adjust</code> argument in <code>corr.p</code> of the psych package (Revelle, 2014). In addition, this argument can be assigned <code>"locfdr"</code> in which edges are set to zero if the local FDR is below <code>FDRcutoff</code>. <code>fdrtool</code> from the fdrtool package (Klaus and Strimmer, 2014) is used to compute these measures, which is used inside <code>FDRnetwork</code>.</p>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>countDiagonal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Should diagonal be counted in EBIC computation? Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>. Set to <code>TRUE</code> to mimic qgraph &lt; 1.3 behavior (not recommended!).

</dl>
<h3>Using qgraph to plot graphs</h3>

<p>The first argument of qgraph(), 'input', is the input. This can be a number of objects but is mainly either a weights matrix or an edgelist. Here we will assume a graph is made of n nodes connected by m edges. qgraph is mainly aimed at visualizing (statistical) relationships between variables as weighted edges. In these edge weights a zero indicates no connection and negative values are comparable in strength to positive values. Many (standardized) statistics follow these rules, the most important example being correlations. In the special case where all edge weights are either 0 or 1 the weights matrix is interpreted as an adjacency matrix and an unweighted graph is made.
</p>
<p>a weights matrix is a square n by n matrix in which each row and column represents a node. The element at row i and column j indicates the connection from node i to node j. If the weights matrix is symmetrical an undirected graph is made and if the matrix is asymmetrical a directed graph is made.
</p>
<p>Alternatively an edgelist can be used. This is a m by 2 matrix (not a list!) in which each row indicates an edge. The first column indicates the number of the start of the edge and the second column indicates the number of the end of the edge. The number of each node is a unique integer between 1 and n. The total number of nodes will be estimated by taking the highest value of the edgelist. If this is incorrect (there are nodes with no edges beyond the ones already specified) the 'nNodes' argument can be used. If an integer between 1 and n is missing in the edgelist it is assumed to be a node with no edges. To create a weighted graph edge weights can be added as a third column in the edgelist. By default using an edgelist creates a directed graph, but this can be set with the 'directed' argument.
</p>


<h3>Interpreting graphs</h3>

<p>In weighted graphs green edges indicate positive weights and red edges indicate negative weights. The color saturation and the width of the edges corresponds to the absolute weight and scale relative to the strongest weight in the graph. It is possible to set this strongest edge by using the 'maximum' argument. When 'maximum' is set to a value above any absolute weight in the graph that value is considered the strongest edge (this must be done to compare different graphs; a good value for correlations is 1). Edges with an absolute value under the 'minimum' argument are omitted (useful to keep filesizes from inflating in very large  graphs). 
</p>
<p>In larger graphs the above edge settings can become hard to interpret. With the 'cut' argument a cutoff value can be set which splits scaling of color and width. This makes the graphs much easier to interpret as you can see important edges and general trends in the same picture. Edges with absolute weights under the cutoff score will have the smallest width and become more colorful as they approach the cutoff score, and edges with absolute weights over the cutoff score will be full red or green and become wider the stronger they are. 
</p>


<h3>Specifying the layout</h3>

<p>The placement of the nodes (i.e. the layout) is specified with the 'layout' argument. It can be manually specified by entering a matrix for this argument. The matrix must have a row for each node and two columns indicating its X and Y coordinate respectively. qgraph plots the nodes on a (-1:1)(-1:1) plane, and the given coordinates will be rescaled to fit this plane unless 'rescale' is FALSE (not recommended).  Another option to manually specify the layout is by entering a matrix with more then two columns. This matrix must then consist of zeroes and a number (the order in the weights matrix) for each node indicating it's place. For example:
</p>
<p>0 0 2 0 0
</p>
<p>1 0 3 0 4
</p>
<p>will place node 2 at the top in the center, node 1 at the bottom left corner, node 3 at the bottom in the center and node 4 at the bottom right corner. It is recommended however that one of the integrated layouts is used. 'layout' can be given a character as argument to accomplish that. layout="circular" will simply place all nodes in a circle if the groups argument is not used and in separate circles per group if the groups argument is used (see next section).
</p>
<p>The circular layout is convenient to see how well the data conforms to a model, but to show how the data clusters another layout is more appropriate. By specifying layout="spring" the Fruchterman-reingold algorithm (Fruchterman &amp; Reingold, 1991), which has been ported from the SNA package (Butts, 2010), can be used to create a force-directed layout. In principle, what this function does is that each node (connected and unconnected) repulse each other, and connected nodes also attract each other. Then after a number of iterations (500 by default) in which the maximum displacement of each node becomes smaller a layout is achieved in which the distance between nodes correspond very well to the absolute edge weight between those nodes.
</p>
<p>A solution to use this function for weighted graphs has been taken from the igraph package (Csardi G &amp; Nepusz T, 2006) in which the same function was ported from the SNA package. New in qgraph are the option to include constraints on the nodes by fixing a coordinate for nodes or reducing the maximum allowed displacement per node. This can be done with the 'layout.par' argument. For more information see <code>qgraph.layout.fruchtermanreingold</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, 'layout' is set to "spring" for unweighted and directed graphs and "circular" otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Grouping nodes</h3>

<p>Grouping nodes (e.g., according to a measurement model) can be specified with the 'groups' argument. This can be a factor or a list in which each element is a vector containing the numbers of nodes that belong together (numbers are taken from the order in the weights matrix). All numbers must be included. If a groups list is specified the "groups" layout can be used to place these nodes together, the nodes in each group will be given a color, and a legend can be plotted (by setting 'legend' to TRUE). The colors will be taken from the 'color' argument, or be generated with the <code>rainbow</code> function.</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>By default qgraph will plot the graph in a new R window. However the graphs are optimized to be plotted in a PDF file. To easily create a pdf file set the 'filetype' argument to "pdf". 'filename' can be used to specify the filename and folder to output in. 'height' and 'width' can be used to specify the height and width of the image in inches. By default a new R window is opened if the current device is the NULL-device, otherwise the current device is used (note that when doing this 'width' and 'height' still optimize the image for those widths and heights, even though the output screen size isn't affected, this is especially important for directed graphs!).
</p>
<p>Furthermore filetype can also be set to numerous other values. Alternatively any output device in R can be used by simply opening the device before calling qgraph and closing it with dev.off() after calling qgraph.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: graphs made in qgraph must be exported programatically using device functions such as pdf() and png(). Manually resizing a graph and using export functions such as the one built into RStudio will give UNSTABLE RESULTS.</p>


<h3>Manual specification of color and width</h3>

<p>In qgraph the widths and colors of each edge can also be manually controlled. To directly specify the width of each edge set the 'mode” argument to "direct". This will then use the absolute edge weights as the width of each edge (negative values can still be used to make red edges). To manually set the color of each edge, set the 'edge.color' argument to a matrix with colors for each edge (when using a weights matrix) or a vector with a color for each edge (when using an edgelist).
</p>


<h3>Replotting graphs and reusing layouts</h3>

<p>If the result of <code>qgraph</code> is stored, such as <code>Graph &lt;- qgraph(...)</code>, the plot can be recreated in two ways. <code>qgraph(Graph, ...))</code> reruns <code>qgraph</code> with the same arguments used in the origina call except those restated in the dots. For example <code>qgraph(Graph, shape = "square")</code> will recreate the same plot but now use square nodes instead of circular. <code>plot(Graph)</code> will NOT rerun <code>qgraph</code> but simply plot the qgraph object. This means that now specific graph attributes can be changed before plotting.
</p>
<p>More specific, <code>qgraph(Graph)</code> will base the new plot only on the <code>Arguments</code> element of the <code>qgraph</code> object and <code>plot(qgraph)</code> will base the new plot on the <code>graphAttributes</code> and  <code>plotOptions</code> elements of the qgraph object.
</p>
<p>To reuse a layout, use the <code>layout</code> element. e.g., to plot a new graph with the same layout use <code>qgraph(..., layout = Graph$layout)</code>
</p>


<h3>Additional information</h3>

<p>By default, edges will be straight between two nodes unless there are two edges between two nodes. To overwrite this behavior the 'bidirectional' argument can be set to TRUE, which will turn two edges between two nodes into one bidirectional edge. 'bidirectional' can also be a vector with TRUE or FALSE for each edge.
</p>
<p>To specify the strength of the curve the argument 'curve' can be used (but only in directional graphs). 'curve' must be given a numerical value that represent an offset from the middle of the straight edge through where the curved edge must be drawn. 0 indicates no curve, and any other value  indicates a curve of that strength. A value of 0.3 is recommended for nice curves. This can be either one number or a vector with the curve of each edge.
</p>
<p>Nodes and edges can be given labels with the 'labels' and the 'edge.labels' arguments. 'labels' can be set to FALSE to omit labels, TRUE (default) to set labels equal to the node number (order in the weights matrix) or it can be a vector with the label for each node. Edge labels can also be set to FALSE to be omitted (default). If 'edge.labels' is TRUE then the weight of each label is printed. Finally, 'edge.labels' can also be a vector with the label for each edge. If a label (both for edges and nodes) contain an asterisk then the asterisk is omitted and that label is printed in the symbol font (useful to print Greek letters).
</p>
<p>A final two things to try: the 'scores' argument can be given a vector with the scores of a person on each variable, which will then be shown using colors of the nodes, And the 'bg' argument can be used to change the background of the graph to another color, or use bg=TRUE for a special background (do set transparency=TRUE when using  background colors other then white).</p>


<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>If this function crashes for any reason with the filetype argument specified, run:
</p>
<p>dev.off()
</p>
<p>To shut down the output device!</p>
