<h2>Mean differences across two independent groups (independent two-samples
t-tests)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>means_diff</code> tests for mean differences across two independent groups
with independent two-samples t-tests. The function also calculates the
descriptive statistics for each group and the standardized mean differences
(i.e., Cohen's d) based on the pooled standard deviations. <code>mean_diff</code>
is simply a wrapper for <code>t.test</code> plus some extra
calculations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">means_diff(
  data,
  vrb.nm,
  bin.nm,
  lvl = levels(as.factor(data[[bin.nm]])),
  var.equal = TRUE,
  d.ci.type = "unbiased",
  ci.level = 0.95,
  check = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame of data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vrb.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of colnames specifying the variables in
<code>data</code> to conduct the independent two-sample t-tests for.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bin.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1 specifying the binary variable in
<code>data</code>. It identifies the two groups with two (and only two) unique
values (other than missing values).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lvl</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector with length 2 specifying the unique values for
the two groups. If <code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> is a factor, then <code>lvl</code>
should be the factor levels rather than the underlying integer codes. This
argument allows you to specify the direction of the mean difference.
<code>means_diff</code> calculates the mean differences as
<code>data[[vrb.nm]][data[[bin.nm]] == lvl[2], ]</code> -
<code>data[[vrb.nm]][data[[bin.nm]] == lvl[1], ]</code> such that it is group 2 -
group 1. By changing which group is group 1 vs. group 2, the direction of
the mean difference can be changed. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var.equal</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying whether the variances
of the groups are assumed to be equal (TRUE) or not (FALSE). If TRUE, a
traditional independent two-samples t-test is computed; if FALSE, Welch's
t-test is computed. These two tests differ by their degrees of freedom and
p-values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d.ci.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector with length 1 specifying the type of
confidence intervals to compute for the standardized mean difference (i.e.,
Cohen's d). There are currently three options: 1) "unbiased" which
calculates the unbiased standard error of Cohen's d based on formula 25 in
Viechtbauer (2007). A symmetrical confidence interval is then calculated
based on the standard error. 2) "tdist" which calculates the confidence
intervals based on the t-distribution using the function
<code>cohen.d.ci</code>, 3) "classic" which calculates the
confidence interval of Cohen's d based on the confidence interval of the
mean difference itself. The lower and upper confidence bounds are divided
by the pooled standard deviation. Technically, this confidence interval is
biased due to not taking into account the uncertainty of the standard
deviations. No standard error is calculated for this option and NA is
returned for "d_se" in the return object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ci.level</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of length 1 specifying the confidence level.
<code>ci.level</code> must range from 0 to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying whether the input
arguments should be checked for errors. For example, if
<code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> has more than 2 unique values (other than missing
values) or if <code>bin.nm</code> is not a colname in <code>data</code>. This is a
tradeoff between computational efficiency (FALSE) and more useful error
messages (TRUE).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>means_diff</code> calculates the mean differences as
<code>data[[vrb.nm]][data[[bin.nm]] == lvl[2], ]</code> -
<code>data[[vrb.nm]][data[[bin.nm]] == lvl[1], ]</code> such that it is group 2 -
group 1. Group 1 corresponds to the first factor level of
<code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> (after being coerced to a factor). Group 2 correspond
to the second factor level of <code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> (after being coerced to a
factor). This was set up to handle dummy coded treatment variables in a
desirable way. For example, if <code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> is a numeric vector with
values <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, the default factor coersion will have the first
factor level be "0" and the second factor level "1". This would result will
correspond to 1 - 0. However, if the first factor level of
<code>data[[bin.nm]]</code> is "treatment" and the second factor level is
"control", the result will correspond to control - treatment. If the opposite
is desired (e.g., treatment - control), this can be reversed within the
function by specifying the <code>lvl</code> argument as
<code>c("control","treatment")</code>. Note, <code>means_diff</code> diverts from
<code>t.test</code> by calculating the mean difference as group 2 - group 1 (as
opposed to the group 1 - group 2 that <code>t.test</code> does). However, group 2 -
group 1 is the convention that <code>psych::cohen.d</code> uses as well.
</p>
<p><code>means_diff</code> calculates the pooled standard deviation in a different way
than <code>cohen.d</code>. Therefore, the Cohen's d estimates (and
confidence intervals if d.ci.type == "tdist") differ from those in
<code>cohen.d</code>. <code>means_diff</code> uses the total degrees of
freedom in the denomenator while <code>cohen.d</code> uses the total
sample size in the denomenator - based on the notation in McGrath &amp; Meyer
(2006). However, almost every introduction to statistics textbook uses the
total degrees of freedom in the denomenator and that is what makes more sense
to me. See examples.
