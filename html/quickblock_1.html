<h2>quickblock: Quick Threshold Blocking</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides functions for assigning treatments in randomized experiments using
near-optimal threshold blocking. The package is made with large data sets in
mind and derives blocks more than an order of magnitude quicker than other
methods.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See <code>quickblock</code> for the main blocking function.
</p>
<p>See the package's website for more information:
