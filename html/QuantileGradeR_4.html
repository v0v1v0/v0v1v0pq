<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gradeBus</code> takes one inspection score for a restaurant (this may be a
mean or the result of a single inspection), the restaurant's ZIP code and a
dataframe of ZIP code cutoffs. It compares each restaurant's inspection score
to cutoff scores in the restaurant's ZIP code.  It finds the smallest cutoff
score in the restaurant's ZIP code that the restaurant's inspection score is
less than or equal to - let's say this is the (<code>letter.index</code>)th cutoff
score - and returns the (<code>letter.index</code>)th letter of the alphabet as the
grade for the restaurant.  <code>gradeBus</code> is the function called by
<code>gradeAllBus</code> in order to grade all businesses.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character representing the grade assigned to the restaurant in
question ('A', 'B', 'C' etc).
