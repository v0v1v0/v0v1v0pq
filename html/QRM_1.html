<h2>Quantitative Risk Modelling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is designed to accompany the book Quantitative
Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools by Alexander
J. McNeil, Rudiger Frey and Paul Embrechts.
</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for quantitative risk management as
introduced in the book “Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts,
Techniques and Tools” (henceforth: QRM). The S-Plus package
“QRMlib” has been made available the first author of the book
and can be obtained by following the instructions on
<a href="https://www.qrmtutorial.org/books">https://www.qrmtutorial.org/books</a>. A R port of
this package has been made available on CRAN by Scott Ulmann. However,
the package failed the checks and hence has been moved to the
CRAN archive (<span class="pkg">QRMlib</span>, version 1.4.5.1 as of 04/25/2011). This
package is based on <span class="pkg">QRMlib</span>, but (i), not all functions have been
ported from <span class="pkg">QRMlib</span> to <span class="pkg">QRM</span>, (ii) the arguments of some
functions have been modified, and (iii) the manual pages have been
re-ordered by topic.<br>
A list of the not ported functions is provided in
<code>QRM-defunct</code> with pointers to their replacements. This 
was achieved by the inclusion of dependencies to the packages
<span class="pkg">gsl</span>, <span class="pkg">numDeriv</span> and <span class="pkg">timeSeries</span> and/or resorting to
functions contained in the base installation of R. Second, in
particular with respect to passing down arguments to the routines used
in optimizations and/or argument matching, modifications to the
functions' closures were necessary. In addition, the names of
arguments in similar functions have been unified. Third, to provide
the user a faster access to the manual pages of certain risk concepts,
the functions' documentation are now ordered by concept rather than by
the name of the functions.<br> 
Without modifying the existing functions of <span class="pkg">QRMlib</span> too much,
neither S3- nor S4-classes and methods have been included completely
by now in <span class="pkg">QRM</span>, but the characteristic of the former package as a
collection of functions pertinent to quantitative risk modelling have
been kept intact. However, this might change in future releases of
<span class="pkg">QRM</span>. By now, the current package can be used almost alike
<span class="pkg">QRMlib</span>, but with the stated modifications.
