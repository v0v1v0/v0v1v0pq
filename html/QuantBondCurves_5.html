<p>Function to calculate the upcoming coupon payment dates of a given asset,
based on its payment frequency. The list of payment dates encompass
the time period between the analysis date and the maturity of the asset.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coupon.dates(
  maturity,
  analysis.date = Sys.Date(),
  asset.type = "TES",
  freq = NULL,
  convention = "F",
  loc = "BOG",
  trade.date = NULL,
  coupon.schedule = "SF"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maturity</code></td>
<td>
<p>Last day of the contract: YYYY-MM-DD.
Alternatively, it can be a numeric value that represents the duration of the contract in years.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>analysis.date</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date in which the asset is valued. By default, the
current date.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>asset.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that determines the asset type to value. See also
'Details'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq</code></td>
<td>
<p>Frequency of payments of a given asset in a year. For LIBOR and
IBR the default frequency is four (quarterly payments). TES has a default

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coupon.schedule</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that establishes if a bond first coupon period is a long

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Upcoming coupon dates and dates of payment according to business day conventions.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If only maturity is given, function assumes that the coupon payments have
already started. If <code>maturity</code> and <code>trade.date</code> are included,
coupon dates are calculated from <code>trade.date</code> to <code>maturity</code>.
If by doing so, <code>trade.date</code> doesn't converge to <code>maturity</code>, month remainder
is adjusted according to <code>coupon.schedule</code>.
For LIBOR assets, function adds 2 business days to <code>trade.date</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coupon.dates("2028-04-03")
coupon.dates(maturity = 2, analysis.date = "2021-10-01")
coupon.dates(maturity = "2029-10-01", asset.type = "FixedIncome", freq = 2, convention = "MB")
coupon.dates(maturity = "2028-02-29", analysis.date = "2022-07-29", trade.date = "2022-07-29",
             asset.type = "TES", coupon.schedule = "SF")
coupon.dates(maturity = "2025-11-30", analysis.date = "2022-03-01", trade.date = "2021-05-31",
             asset.type = "IBR", loc = "NY", convention = "F")
