<h2>quickmatch: Quick Generalized Full Matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides functions for constructing near-optimal generalized full matchings.
Generalized full matching is an extension of the original full matching method
to situations with more intricate study designs. The package is made with
large data sets in mind and derives matchings more than an order of magnitude
quicker than other methods.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See <code>quickmatch</code> for the main matching function.
