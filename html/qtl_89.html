<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The formula is used to specified the model to be fit. In the
formula, use <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, etc., or <code>q1</code>,
<code>q2</code>, etc., to represent the QTLs, and the column names in the
covariate data frame to represent the covariates.
</p>
<p>We enforce a hierarchical structure on the model formula: if a QTL or
covariate is in involved in an interaction, its main effect must also
be included.
</p>
<p>In the drop-one-term analysis, for a given QTL/covariate model, all
submodels will be analyzed.  For each term in the input formula, when
it is dropped, all higher order terms that contain it will also be
dropped.  The comparison between the new model and the full (input)
model will be output.
</p>
<p>The estimated percent variances explained for the QTL are simply
transformations of the conditional LOD scores by the formula <code class="reqn">h^2
  = 1 - 10^{-(2/n) {\rm LOD}}</code>.  While these may be reasonable for
unlinked, additive QTL, <b>they can be completely wrong in the case
of linked QTL</b>, but we don't currently have any alternative.
</p>
<p>For <code>model="binary"</code>, a logistic regression model is used.
</p>
<p><b>The part to get estimated QTL effects is not complete for the
case of the X chromosome and 4-way crosses.  The values returned in
these cases are based on a design matrix that is convenient for
calculations but not easily interpreted.</b>
</p>
<p>The estimated QTL effects for a backcross are derived by the coding
scheme <code class="reqn">\pm</code> 1/2 for AA and AB, so that the additive
effect corresponds to the difference between phenotype averages for
the two genotypes.  For doubled haploids and RIL, the coding scheme is
<code class="reqn">\pm</code> 1 for AA and BB, so that the additive effect
corresponds to half the difference between the phenotype averages for
the two homozygotes.
</p>
<p>For an intercross, the additive effect is derived from the coding
scheme -1/0/+1 for genotypes AA/AB/BB, and so is half the difference
between the phenotype averages for the two homozygotes.  The dominance
deviation is derived from the coding scheme 0/+1/0 for genotypes
AA/AB/BB, and so is the difference between the phenotype average for
the heterozygotes and the midpoint between the phenotype averages for
the two homozygotes.
</p>
<p>Epistatic effects and QTL <code class="reqn">\times</code> covariate interaction
effects are obtained through the products of the corresponding
additive/dominant effect columns.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>fitqtl</code>. It may contains as many as four components:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>result.full</code> is the ANOVA table as a matrix for the full model
result. It contains the degree of freedom (df), Sum of squares (SS),
mean square (MS), LOD score (LOD), percentage of variance explained
(%var) and P value (Pvalue).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lod</code> is the LOD score from the fit of the full model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>result.drop</code> is a drop-one-term ANOVA table as a
matrix. It contains degrees of freedom (df), Type III sum of squares
(Type III SS), LOD score(LOD), percentage of variance explained
(%var), F statistics (F value), and P values for chi square
(Pvalue(chi2)) and F distribution (Pvalue(F)).  Note that the degree
of freedom, Type III sum of squares, the LOD score and the
percentage of variance explained are the values comparing the full
to the sub-model with the term dropped. Also note that for
imputation method, the percentage of variance explained, the the F
values and the P values are approximations calculated from the LOD
score.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ests</code> contains the estimated QTL effects and standard errors.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>method="normal"</code>, residuals are saved as an attribute of
the output, named <code>"residuals"</code> and accessible via the
<code>attr</code> function.
</p>
<p><b>The part to get estimated QTL effects is fully working only for
the case of autosomes in a backcross, intercross, RIL or doubled haploids.
In other cases the values returned are based on a
design matrix that is convenient for calculations but not easily
interpreted.</b>
