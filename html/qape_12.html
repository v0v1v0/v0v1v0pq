<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Double-bootstrap method considered by Hall and Maiti (2006) and  Erciulescu and Fuller (2013) is used. Vectors of random effects and random components are generated from the multivariate normal distribution and REML estimates of model parameters are used. Random effects are generated for all population elements even for subsets with zero sample sizes (for which random effects are not estimated). Double-bootstrap MSE estimator presented in Hall and Maiti (2006) and  Erciulescu and Fuller (2013) are taken into account. The QAPE is a quantile of absolute prediction error which means that at least p100% of realizations of absolute prediction errors are smaller or equal to QAPE. The parallel processing is performed via the <em>future.apply</em> package.
