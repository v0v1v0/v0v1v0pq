<h2>Calculates the domain-based scale scores using the data of QLQ-BR23</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a dataset containing the domain-based scale scores using
the data from QLQ-BR23
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">brc_qol(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with ID, BR_Q31,BR_Q32,...,BR_Q53 columns along with other columns if data is available.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>brc_miss function inputs either a dataset containing missing information, represented as,
9 or 99 or NA or a data not containing any missing information. It extracts only the columns
named 'BR_Q31','BR_Q32',...,'BR_Q53' and replaces the missing data with the minimum value of the particular question.
</p>
<p>Using each of the 30 columns, the Raw Score is computed, and one column is obtained containing
the Raw Score for each patient.
</p>
<p>Further, using each of the Raw Scores, three domain-based Scale Scores are computed,
they are, Global Scales Score, Functional Scales Score and Symptoms Scales Score.
</p>
<p>Thus, the columns 'BR_Q31','BR_Q32',...,'BR_Q53' are replaced by the domain-based scale scores,
which is obtained as the output.
</p>
<p>brc_qol(x)
</p>
<p>1) Subject ID column should be named as 'ID'.
</p>
<p>2) Each question column should be named as 'BR_Q31' for data from question 31,
'BR_Q32' for data from question 32, and so on until 'BR_Q53' for data from question 53
</p>
<p>3) Data may contain more variables, such as, Age, Gender, etc.
</p>
<p>x - A data frame with ID, BR_Q31,BR_Q32,...,BR_Q53 columns along with other columns if data
is available.
</p>
<p>rs - A matrix containing the Raw Score computed using all BR_Q31 to BR_Q53 data for each
patient. The RS(a) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>fs - A matrix containing the Functional Scale Scores computed using all BR_Q31 to BR_Q53
data for each patient. The FS(a,b) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>ss - A matrix containing the Global Scale Scores computed using all BR_Q31 to BR_Q53
data for each patient. The SS(a,b) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>final_data - A data frame formed by replacing the columns 'BR_Q31','BR_Q32',...,'BR_Q53' by
the domain-based scale scores.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame by replacing the columns 'BR_Q31','BR_Q32',...,'BR_Q53' by the domain-based scale scores.
