<h2>Mahalanobis squared distances of Brownlee's stack loss plant operation data based only on the explanatory variates (air flow, water temperature, and acid concentration).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mahalanobis distances were calculated using the mahalanobis R function. 
Under standard normal theory, these are approximately Chi-squared on 3 degrees of freedom.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stacklossDistances
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 21 rows and 2 variates:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ordinary</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mahalanobis squared distances from the arithemetic mean using the eliptical contours of the sample covariance matrix.</p>
</dd>
<dt>robust</dt>
<dd>
<p>As with distances, these are Mahalobis squared distances butnow based on robust measures of location and covariance matrix (as determined from the default covRob of the robust package).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>with(stacklossDistances, qqtest(robust,dist="chi", df=3))</code> will show "outliers".
</p>
<p><code>with(stacklossDistances, qqtest(ordinary,dist="chi", df=3))</code> will show "inliers".
