<h2>Generation of intermediate solutions for individual partitions of
clustered set-relational data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>partition_min_inter</code> decomposes clustered data into individual
partitions such as cross-sections and time-series for panel
data. It derives an individual intermediate solution for each partition
and the pooled data to assess the robustness of the
solutions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

  out,
  n_cut,

  BE_ncut,
  WI_ncut
)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe summarizing the partition-specific and pooled solutions
with the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>type</code>: The type of the partition. <code>pooled</code> are rows with information
on the pooled data; <code>between</code> is for cross-section partitions;
<code>within</code> is for time-series partitions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>partition</code>: Specific dimension of the partition at hand. For
between-dimension, the unit identifiers are included here  (argument <code>units</code>).
For the within-dimension, the time identifier are listed (argument <code>time</code>).
The entry is <code>-</code> for the pooled data without partitions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>solution</code>: The solution derived for the partition or the pooled data.
Absence of a condition is denoted by the <code>~</code> sign.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>model</code>: Running ID for models. In the presence of model ambiguity, each
model has its own row with its individual solution and parameters. The rest of
the information in the row is duplicated, for example by having two rows for
the within-partition 1996. The column <code>model</code> highlights the presence of
model ambiguity by numbering all models belonging to the same solution. For
example, if three consecutive rows are numbered 1, 2 and 3, then these rows
belong to the same solution and represent model ambiguity. If a 1 in a row
is followed by another 1, then there is no model ambiguity.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>consistency</code>: The consistency score (a.k.a. inclusion score)
for the partition of the data or the pooled data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>coverage</code>: The coverage score for the partition of the data
or the pooled data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
