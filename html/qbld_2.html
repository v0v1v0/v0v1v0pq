<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set presented by Fitzmaurice and Laird (1993) contains complete records
on 537 children from Steubnville, Ohio, each woman was examined annually at ages 7 through 10. 
The repeated binary response is the wheezing status (1="yes", 0="no") of a child at each occasion. 
Although mother's smoking status could vary with time, it was determined in the first interview and 
was treated as a time-independent covariate. Maternal smoking was categorized as 1 if the mother
smoked regularly and 0 otherwise.</p>
