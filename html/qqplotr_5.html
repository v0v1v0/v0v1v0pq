<h2>Q-Q and P-P plot extensions for 'ggplot2'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package extends some <code>ggplot2</code> functionalities by permitting the
drawing of both quantile-quantile (Q-Q) and probability-probability (P-P)
points, lines, and confidence bands. The functions of this package also allow
the detrend adjustment, proposed by Thode (2002), which helps reduce visual
bias when assessing those plots.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions of this package, presented as <code>ggplot2</code> Stats, are divided
into two groups: Q-Q and P-P related.
</p>
<p>Each of the groups is composed of three Stats: <code>point</code>, <code>line</code>, and
<code>band</code>. Those Stats, while independent, complement each other when
plotted together.
