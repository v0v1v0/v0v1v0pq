<h2>Rainbow trout doubled haploid data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from doubled haploid individuals derived from a cross between Oregon
State University (OSU) and Clearwater (CW) River rainbow trout clonal lines.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trout
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>cross</code>.  See <code>qtl::read.cross()</code>
for details.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Doubled haploid individuals were produced from a cross between Oregon State
University (OSU) and Clearwater (CW) river rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus
mykiss</em>) clonal lines.  Eggs from one of eight outbred females, two from
Troutlodge (TL) and six from Spokane (SP), were irradiated to destroy
maternal nuclear DNA and fertilized with sperm from a single <code class="reqn">F_1</code>
male.  The first embryonic cleavage was blocked by heat shock to restore
diploidy.  There are a total of 554 individuals, with between 8 and 168
individuals from each of the eight females.
</p>
<p>The primary phenotype is time to hatch (<code>tth</code>).  An additional
"phenotype", <code>female</code>, indicates maternal cytoplasmic environment (the
source of the egg).
</p>
<p>There are genotype data on 171 markers on 28 linkage groups.  The linkage
groups are named as in Nichols et al. (2002), though a pair of markers are
assigned to linkage group "un", as they don't connect to any of the linkage
groups in Nichols et al. (2002).
</p>
<p>Note that the data have cross type <code>"dh"</code> (for doubled haploids); in
R/qtl they are treated just like a backcross, except that genotypes are
referred to as the homozygotes.
