<h2>Transcriptomes of Pinus roots under a Temperature Gradient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset gives the TPM values of 200 selected genes obtained from 60 Pinus root
samples (30 samples each for training and test data) under a temperature gradient,
generated by RNA-seq.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Pinus</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A gene expression data matrix of 30 root samples of P. thunbergii under five
temperature conditions (8, 13, 18, 23, 28 Â°C) with six biological replicates is in
the first element of the list.
</p>
<p>A gene expression data matrix of another 30 root samples of P. thunbergii under
the same condition is in the second one.
</p>
<p>Temperature conditions where 30 root samples in each data matrix were generated are
in the third one.
</p>
<p>Gene expressions are normalized in the TPM value.
