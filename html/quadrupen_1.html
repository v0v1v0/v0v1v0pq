<h2>quadrupen: Sparsity by Worst-Case Quadratic Penalties</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits classical sparse regression models with efficient active set algorithms by solving quadratic problems as described by Grandvalet, Chiquet and Ambroise (2017) <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1210.2077">doi:10.48550/arXiv.1210.2077</a>. Also provides a few methods for model selection purpose (cross-validation, stability selection).
</p>
<p>This package is designed to fit accurately several popular
penalized linear regression models using the algorithm proposed in
Grandvalet, Chiquet and Ambroise (submitted) by solving quadratic
problems with increasing size.
</p>


<h3>Features</h3>

<p>At the moment, two <code>R</code> fitting functions are available:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> the <code>elastic.net</code> function, which solves a family of
linear regression problems penalized by a mixture of
<code class="reqn">\ell_1</code> and <code class="reqn">\ell_2</code> norms. It notably includes
the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996), the adaptive-LASSO (Zou, 2006), the
Elastic-net (Zou and Hastie, 2006) or the Structured Elastic-net
(Slawski et al., 2010). See examples as well as the available
<code>demo(quad_enet)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>bounded.reg</code> function, which fits a linear model
penalized by a mixture of <code class="reqn">\ell_\infty</code> and
<code class="reqn">\ell_2</code> norms. It owns the same versatility as the
<code>elastic.net</code> function regarding the <code class="reqn">\ell_2</code> norm,
yet the <code class="reqn">\ell_1</code>-norm is replaced by the infinity
norm. Check <code>demo(quad_breg)</code> and examples.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem commonly solved for these two functions writes



β<sup>hat</sup><sub>λ<sub>1</sub>,λ<sub>2</sub></sub> = argmin<sub>β</sub> 1/2 RSS(β) + λ<sub>1</sub> | D β |<sub>q</sub> + λ/2 <sub>2</sub>β<sup>T</sup> S β, 

 where
<code class="reqn">q=1</code> for <code>elastic.net</code> and
<code class="reqn">q=\infty</code> for <code>bounded.reg</code>.  The diagonal
matrix <code class="reqn">D</code> allows different weights for the first part of
the penalty. The structuring matrix <code class="reqn">S</code> can be used to
introduce some prior information regarding the predictors. It is
provided via a positive semidefinite matrix.
</p>
<p>The S4 objects produced by the fitting procedures own the
classical methods for linear model in <code>R</code>, as well as methods
for plotting, (double) cross-validation and for the stability
selection procedure of Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010).
</p>
<p>All the examples of this documentation have been included to the
package source, in the 'examples' directory. Some (too few!)
routine testing scripts using the <span class="pkg">testhat</span> package are also
present in the 'tests' directory, where we check basic
functionalities of the code, especially the reproducibility of the
Lasso/Elastic-net solution path with the <span class="pkg">lars</span>,
<span class="pkg">elasticnet</span> and <span class="pkg">glmnet</span> packages.  We also check the
handling of runtime errors or unstabilities.
</p>


<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>The general strategy of the algorithm relies on maintaining an
active set of variables, starting from a vector of zeros. The
underlying optimization problem is solved only on the activated
variables, thus handling with small smooth problems with
increasing size. Hence, by considering a decreasing grid of values
for the penalty <code class="reqn">\lambda_1</code> and fixing
<code class="reqn">\lambda_2</code>, we may explore the whole path of
solutions at a reasonable numerical cost, providing that
<code class="reqn">\lambda_1</code> does not end up too small.
</p>
<p>For the <code class="reqn">\ell_1</code>-based methods (available in the
<code>elastic.net</code> function), the size of the underlying problems
solved is related to the number of nonzero coefficients in the
vector of parameters. With the <code class="reqn">\ell_\infty</code>-norm,
(available in the <code>boundary.reg</code> function), we do not produce
sparse estimator. Nevertheless, the size of the systems solved
along the path deals with the number of unbounded variables for
the current penalty level, which is quite smaller than the number
of predictors for a reasonable <code class="reqn">\lambda_1</code>. The same
kind of proposal was made in Zhao, Rocha and Yu (2009).
</p>
<p>Underlying optimization is performed by direct resolution of
quadratic sub problems, which is the main purpose of this
package. This strategy is thoroughly exposed in Grandvalet,
Chiquet and Ambroise (submitted). Still, we also implemented the
popular and versatile proximal (FISTA) approaches for routine
checks and numerical comparisons. A coordinate descent approach is
also included, yet only for the <code>elastic.net</code> fitting
procedure.
</p>
<p>The default setting uses the quadratic approach that gives its
name to the package. It has been optimized to be the method of
choice for small and medium scale problems, and produce very
accurate solutions. However, the first order methods (coordinate
descent and FISTA) can be interesting in situations where the
problem is close to singular, in which case the Cholesky
decomposition used in the quadratic solver can be computationally
unstable. Though it is extremely unlikely for
<code>elastic.net</code> – and if so, we encourage the user to
send us back any report of such an event –, this happens at times
with <code>bounded.reg</code>. Regarding this issue, we let the
possibility for the user to run the optimization of the
<code>bounded.reg</code> criterion in a (hopefully) 'bulletproof'
mode: using mainly the fast and accurate quadratic approach, it
switches to the slower but more robust proximal resolution when
unstability is detected.
</p>


<h3>Technical remarks</h3>

<p>Most of the numerical work is done in C++, relying on the
<span class="pkg">RcppArmadillo</span> package. We also provide a (double)
cross-validation procedure and functions for stability selection,
both using the multi-core capability of the computer, through the
<span class="pkg">parallel</span> package. This feature is not available for Windows
user, though. Finally, note that the plot methods enjoy some
(still very few) of the capabilities of the <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> package.
</p>
<p>We hope to enrich <span class="pkg">quadrupen</span> with other popular fitting
procedures and develop other statistical tools, particularly
towards bootstrapping and model selection purpose. Sparse matrix
encoding is partially supported at the moment, and will hopefully
be thoroughly available in the future, thanks to upcoming updates
of the great <span class="pkg">RcppArmadillo</span> package.
