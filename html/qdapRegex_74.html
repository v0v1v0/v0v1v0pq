<h2>qdapRegex: Regular Expression Removal, Extraction, &amp; Replacement Tools for the <span class="pkg">qdap</span> Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">qdapRegex</span> is a collection of regular expression tools associated with 
the <span class="pkg">qdap</span> package that may be useful outside of the context of discourse
analysis.  Tools include removal/extraction/replacement of abbreviations, 
dates, dollar amounts, email addresses, hash tags, numbers, percentages, 
citations, person tags, phone numbers, times, and zip codes.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">qdapRegex</span> package does not aim to compete with string manipulation 
packages such as 
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stringr"><span class="pkg">stringr</span></a> 
or <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stringi"><span class="pkg">stringi</span></a> 
but is meant to provide access to canned, common regular expression patterns 
that can be used within <span class="pkg">qdapRegex</span>, with <span class="pkg">R</span>'s own regular 
expression functions, or add on string manipulation packages such as 
<code>stringr</code> and <code>stringi</code>.
