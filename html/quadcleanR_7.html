<h2>Simple Coral Quadrat Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>data_frame</code> that can be used with the Simple Examples
of Functions vignette to learn how the cleaning functions in quadcleanR work.
Data was collected by the <a href="https://www.juliakbaum.org/">Baum Lab</a>
and Kiritimati Field Teams. Data is the uncleaned version of data found in
Maucieri and Baum 2021. Biological Conservation. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109328">doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109328</a>
The data are from photo quadrats (1m by 1m) which were randomly annotated
with 100 random points each. At each of these annotated points, the substrate
was identified. Photo quadrats were collected on Kiritimati Island in the
Republic of Kiribati and document coral cover over time and space. The
annotations and output of the <code>data_frame</code> were produced using
<a href="https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/">CoralNet</a> and all annotations were done manually,
by trained researchers.
