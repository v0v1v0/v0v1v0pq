<h2>Quantity-intensity relationship derived through linear regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The quantity-intensity (Q/I) relationships of soil K, introduced by Beckett (1964), is implemented in this function using linear regression equation as used by some earlier workers (Zhang et al., 2011; Islam et al., 2017; Das et al., 2019; 2021).
</p>

NH4OAC_K = NH4OAC_K)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A number of parameters related to soil K availability can be obtained from the Q/I plot, e.g., equilibrium activity ratio (AReK), total labile K (KL), non-specifically held K (-deltaK0), specifically held K (Ks), potential buffering capacity (PBCK), and standard free energy of exchange (deltaG0). The equilibrium activity ratio (AReK) is defined as the activity ratio of K to Ca or 'Ca+Mg' when there is no net adsorption or desorption of K between soil solution and exchange phases. It is a measure of the intensity factor. Total labile K is the amount of K held on the soil solids which is capable of ion exchange reactions during the time period provided for equilibration between soil solution and soil solids. It is a measure of the quantity factor. Conventionally, the total labile K has been sub-divided into non-specifically held K, which is mainly bound to the planar sites; and specifically held K, which is mainly bound to the edge/wedge positions of 2:1 clay minerals (Sparks and Liebhardt, 1981). The potential buffering capacity (PBCK) is a measure of the ability of a soil to resist the changes in intensity factor after additions or losses of K from the system.
