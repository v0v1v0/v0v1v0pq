<h2>Validation of a Qualitative Interaction Tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A bootstrap-based validation procedure to estimate the optimism in the effect sizes of a
QUINT tree which gives insight in the generalizability of the results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">quint.validate(object, B = 10, allresults = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>a (pruned) QUINT tree object of class <code>quint</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of bootstrap samples. Default number is 10; for better accuracy <code class="reqn">B</code>=1000
is recommended.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allresults</code></td>
<td>
<p>option to return an extended list of output. Default is set to FALSE.
See <em>Value</em> section for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this procedure bootstrap trees are grown of the same leaf size as the (pruned)
QUINT tree. The bootstrap samples are drawn from the data used to grow the original tree. For every
bootstrap tree the largest and smallest (i.e., largest negative) treatment mean differences
(or treatment effect sizes) of two leaves are saved. Treatment mean differences in the
leaves are then predicted using the original data set as input for each bootstrapped tree.
From these predictions, the largest and smallest treatment mean differences are saved.
For each bootstrap tree, the largest predicted treatment effect is subtracted from
the largest treatment effect in the bootstrap sample. The average of these values
is the bias (i.e., the optimism) for the largest treatment effects. This is done likewise for
the smallest treatment effects. Subsequently, the bias is computed as the difference between
the bias for the largest effects minus the bias for the smallest effects.
</p>
<p>The details of this validaton procedure are described in Appendix C of Dusseldorp &amp; Van Mechelen (2014).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list with the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>estopt</code></td>
<td>
<p>the estimated optimism for either the treatment effect size (biasd) or the
raw treatment mean difference (biasdif).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>li</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with leaf information output similar to the leaf information output
of the (pruned) QUINT tree object. An extra column is added for the bias-corrected
differences in treatment outcomes (d or diff). The bias-corrected values are only computed
for the leaves with the most extreme values, i.e. the largest and smallest treatment effects.
Hence, the other leaves get the value NA in this column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>optd</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with computed estimated optimism of the treatment effect size per
bootstrapp tree. The first column contains the difference between the largest and smallest
effect size of the bootstrapped tree. The second column contains the difference between the
largest and smallest predicted effect size. Returned when <code>allresults</code> is set to TRUE and
<code>crit='es'</code> is specified in the QUINT object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>optdif</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with computed estimated optimism of the raw mean difference bootstrapped tree.
The first column contains the difference between the largest and smallest raw mean difference of
the bootstrapped tree. The second column contains the difference between the
largest and smallest predicted raw mean difference. Returned when <code>allresults</code> is set to
TRUE and <code>crit='es'</code> is specified in the QUINT object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resultd</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector with the estimated overall mean optimism, the mean bias for the smallest
and for the largest effect size. Returned when <code>allresults</code> is set to
TRUE and <code>crit="es"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resultdif</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector with the estimated overall mean optimism, the mean bias for the smallest and
largest raw mean difference. Returned when <code>allresults</code> is set to TRUE and <code>crit="dm"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
