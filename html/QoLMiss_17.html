<h2>Cancer Quality of Life data analysis with missing values.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a dataset containing the domain-based scale scores using
the data from Quality of Life questionnaire
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qol_miss(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with ID, Q1, Q2,..., Q30 columns along with other columns if data is available.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Calculates the domain-based scale scores using the data from
Quality of Life questionnaire
</p>
<p>miss_patient function inputs a dataset in which the information of some patients
are completely missing. The information of these patients are omitted from the data
and only the columns named 'Q1','Q2',...,'Q30' are extracted.
</p>
<p>Using each of the 30 columns, the Raw Score is computed, and one column is obtained containing
the Raw Score for each patient.
</p>
<p>Further, using each of the Raw Scores, three domain-based Scale Scores are computed,
they are, Global Scales Score, Functional Scales Score and Symptoms Scales Score.
</p>
<p>Thus, the columns 'Q1','Q2',...,'Q30' are replaced by the domain-based scale scores,
which is obtained as the output.
</p>
<p>qol_miss(x)
</p>
<p>1) Subject ID column should be named as 'ID'.
</p>
<p>2) Each question column should be named as 'Q1' for data from question 1,
'Q2' for data from question 2, and so on until 'Q30' for data from question 30.
</p>
<p>3) Only those data can be used which contains no information for some patients, that is, some rows contain only NA.
</p>
<p>4) Data may contain more variables, such as, Age, Gender, etc.
</p>
<p>x - A data frame with ID, Q1, Q2,..., Q30 columns along with other columns if data
is available.
</p>
<p>rs - A matrix containing the Raw Score computed using all Q1 to Q30 data for each
patient. The RS(a) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>fs - A matrix containing the Functional Scale Scores computed using all Q1 to Q30
data for each patient. The FS(a,b) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>ss_gs - A matrix containing the Global Scale Scores computed using all Q1 to Q30
data for each patient. The SS_GS(a,b) function is used in this case.
</p>
<p>final_data - A data frame formed by replacing the columns 'Q1','Q2',...,'Q30' by
the domain-based scale scores.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame by replacing the columns 'Q1','Q2',...,'Q30' by the domain-based scale scores.
