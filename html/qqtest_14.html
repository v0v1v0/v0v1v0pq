<h2>Storage, in millions of gallons daily per square mile of net land area, at the Wachusett Reservoir in Massacusetts - storage computed for each of several rates of draft (draft being a determined maintainable flow in 1,000s of gallons per square mile daily).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>First extensive published use of normal qqplots. Hazen uses a=1/2 to make the p values for the plots.  Hazen doesn'tplot zeros but has them contribute to the sample size. The context of use is in a study of the relation between the water storage provided in a reservoir on any stream and the quantity of water that can be continuously supplied by it.  To quote the paper: ... treat all the remaining variations on the basis of probabilities, using all data from a number of streams; and to study them in comparison with the normal law of error."

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>qqtest(WachusettReservoir$draft800,dist="uniform", a=1/2,type="o")</code> will effect Hazen's original plot for a draft of 800,000 gallons per square mile daily.
</p>
<p><code>qqtest(WachusettReservoir$draft800,dist="normal", a=1/2, type="o")</code> will effect Hazen's normal qq plot for a draft of 800,000 gallons per square mile daily.
