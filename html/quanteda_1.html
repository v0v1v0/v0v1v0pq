<h2>An R package for the quantitative analysis of textual data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for creating and managing textual corpora, extracting
features from textual data, and analyzing those features using quantitative
methods.
</p>
<p>A fast, flexible, and comprehensive framework for quantitative text analysis in R. Provides functionality for corpus management, creating and manipulating tokens and n-grams, exploring keywords in context, forming and manipulating sparse matrices of documents by features and feature co-occurrences, analyzing keywords, computing feature similarities and distances, applying content dictionaries, applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning, visually representing text and text analyses, and more.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">quanteda</span> makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a
corpus, defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level
variables specific to each text, as well as meta-data. <span class="pkg">quanteda</span>
includes tools to make it easy and fast to manipulate the texts in a
corpus, by performing the most common natural language processing tasks
simply and quickly, such as tokenizing, stemming, or forming ngrams.
<span class="pkg">quanteda</span>'s functions for tokenizing texts and forming multiple
tokenized documents into a document-feature matrix are both extremely fast
and very simple to use. <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> can segment texts easily by words,
paragraphs, sentences, or even user-supplied delimiters and tags.
</p>
<p>Built on the text processing functions in the <span class="pkg">stringi</span> package,
which is in turn built on C++ implementation of the ICU libraries for
Unicode text handling, <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> pays special attention to fast and
correct implementation of Unicode and the handling of text in any character
set.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">quanteda</span> is built for efficiency and speed, through its design
around three infrastructures: the <span class="pkg">stringi</span> package for text
processing, the <span class="pkg">Matrix</span> package for sparse matrix objects, and
computationally intensive processing (e.g. for tokens) handled in
parallelized C++. If you can fit it into memory, <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> will handle
it quickly. (And eventually, we will make it possible to process objects
even larger than available memory.)
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">quanteda</span> is principally designed to allow users a fast and
convenient method to go from a corpus of texts to a selected matrix of
documents by features, after defining what the documents and features. The
package makes it easy to redefine documents, for instance by splitting them
into sentences or paragraphs, or by tags, as well as to group them into
larger documents by document variables, or to subset them based on logical
conditions or combinations of document variables. The package also
implements common NLP feature selection functions, such as removing
stopwords and stemming in numerous languages, selecting words found in
dictionaries, treating words as equivalent based on a user-defined
"thesaurus", and trimming and weighting features based on document
frequency, feature frequency, and related measures such as tf-idf.
</p>
<p>Tools for working with dictionaries are one of <span class="pkg">quanteda</span>'s
principal strengths, and the package includes several core functions for
preparing and applying dictionaries to texts, for example for lexicon-based
sentiment analysis.
</p>
<p>Once constructed, a <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> document-feature matrix ("dfm")
can be easily analyzed using either <span class="pkg">quanteda</span>'s built-in tools for
scaling document positions, or used with a number of other text analytic
tools, such as: topic models (including converters for direct use with the
topicmodels, LDA, and stm packages) document scaling (using the
<span class="pkg">quanteda.textmodels</span> package's functions for the "wordfish" and
"Wordscores" models, or direct use with the <strong>ca</strong> package for
correspondence analysis), or machine learning through a variety of other
packages that take matrix or matrix-like inputs. <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> includes
functions for converting its core objects, but especially a dfm, into other
formats so that these are easy to use with other analytic packages.
</p>
<p>Additional features of <span class="pkg">quanteda</span> include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> powerful, flexible tools for working with dictionaries;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the ability to identify keywords
associated with documents or groups of documents;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the ability to explore texts using keywords-in-context;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> quick computation of word or document statistics, using the
<span class="pkg">quanteda.textstats</span> package, for clustering or to compute distances
for other purposes;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a comprehensive suite of descriptive statistics on text
such as the number of sentences, words, characters, or syllables per
document; and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> flexible, easy to use graphical tools to portray many of the analyses
available in the package.
