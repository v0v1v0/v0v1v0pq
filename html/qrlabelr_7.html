<h2>Generate Machine- And Human-Readable Plot Labels for Experiments.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A no-frills open-source solution for designing experimental or trial plot labels
affixed with QR codes. 'qrlabelr' is an R package that features 'EasyQrlabelr',
a Shiny app that simplifies the complicated process of plot label design for non-R users.
It also offers easily 'customizable' functions that enable plot label generation outside the Shiny app.
It generates field plot labels that are compatible with the widely used
digital data collection mobile app, Field Book. Our software builds on the foundation
of an existing open-source program to offer more flexibility in plot label creation steps;
guarantees true string fidelity after QR encoding; and provides faster label generation to users..
</p>


<h3>Available vignettes</h3>

<p>This package comes with one vignette to get users up to speed as soon as possible. It
provides a more thorough guide on how to use qrlabelr, from the data import
stage to the generation of labels and saving it for printing. To access the vignette,
run the command:
<code>browseVignettes("qrlabelr")</code>
