<h2>Generalizability Theory Reliability of Multiple Multilevel Scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>gtheorys_ml</code> uses generalizability theory to compute the reliability
coefficients of multiple multilevel score. It computes within-group
coefficients that assess the reliability of the group-deviated scores (e.g.,
after calling <code>centers_by</code>) and between-group coefficients that
assess the reliability of the mean aggregate scores (e.g., after calling
<code>aggs</code>). It assumes two-level data where the rows are in long
format and the columns are the variables/items of the score. Generaliability
theory coefficients with multilevel data are analagous to intraclass
correlations (ICC), but add an additional grouping variable. The default
computes a multilevel version of ICC(3,k) from <code>cross.obs</code> = TRUE. When
<code>cross.obs</code> = FALSE, a multilevel version of ICC(2,k) is computed, which
takes mean differences between variables/items into account.
<code>gtheorys_ml</code> is a wrapper function for <code>mlr</code>. Note,
this function can take several minutes to run if you have a moderate to large
dataset.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame of data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vrb.nm.list</code></td>
<td>
<p>list of character vectors of colnames from <code>data</code>
specifying the sets of variables/items.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grp.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1 with colname from <code>data</code>
specifying the grouping variable. Because <code>gtheorys_ml</code> is specific to
two-level data, this can only be one variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obs.nm</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of of length 1 with colname from <code>data</code>
specifying the observation variable. In this context, observation refers to
comparable cases across groups. In a longitudinal study, the groups are
people and the observations are timepoints. For example, each person has a
timepoint 1, timepoint 2, timepoint 3, etc. In an school study, the groups
are classrooms and the observations are students. For example, each
classroom has a student 1, student 2, student 3, etc. While longitudinal
studies often have a time variable in their data, school studies don't have
always a student variable. You would then have to create a student variable
to be able to use this function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cross.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying whether the
observations should be crossed when computing the generalizability theory
coefficients. If TRUE, the observations are treated as fixed; if FALSE, they
are treated as random. See details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gtheorys_ml</code> uses <code>mlr</code>, which is based on the
formulas in Shrout, Patrick, and Lane (2012). When <code>cross.obs</code> = TRUE,
the within-group coefficient is Rc and the between-group coefficient is RkF.
When <code>cross.obs</code> = FALSE, the within-group coefficient is Rcn and the
between-group coefficient is RkRn.
</p>
<p><code>gtheorys_ml</code> does not currently have standard errors or confidence
intervals. I am not aware of mathematical formulas for analytical confidence
intervals, and because the generaliability theory coefficients can take
several minutes to estimate, bootstraped confidence intervals seem too
time-intensive to be useful at the moment.
</p>
<p><code>gtheorys_ml</code> does not work with multiple single variable/item scores.
You can still use generalizability theory to estimate between-group
reliability in that instance though. To do so, reshape the multiple single
variables/items from long to wide (e.g., <code>long2wide</code>) so that you
have a column for each observation of that single variable/item and the rows
are the groups. Then you can use <code>gtheorys</code> and treat each observation as
a "different" variable/item.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list with two elements. The first is named "within" and refers to the
within-group reliability. The second is named "between" and refers to the
between-group reliability. Each contains a data.frame with the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>est</dt>
<dd>
<p>generalizability theory reliability coefficient itself</p>
</dd>
<dt>average_r</dt>
<dd>
<p>the average correlation at each level of the data based on
<code>cor_ml</code> (which is a wrapper for <code>statsBy</code>)</p>
</dd>
<dt>nvrb</dt>
<dd>
<p>number of variables/items that make up that score</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The later two columns are included because even though the reliability coefficients
are calculated from variance components, they are indirectly based on the average
correlation and number of variables/items similar to Cronbach's alpha.
