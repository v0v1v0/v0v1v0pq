<h2>Internal Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The above functions are internal in the QCA package which are not designed to
be called directly by the user. All of them are used by the <code>minimize</code> function,
except <code>sortMatrix</code> which is used by <code>allExpressions</code>. The verification
and error messages have been moved to the internal functions <code>verify.data</code>
and <code>verify.tt</code>.
