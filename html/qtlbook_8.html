<h2>Interspecific backcross in Drosophila</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on ovariole number in a backcross between <em>D. simulans</em> and
<em>D. sechellia</em>; the majority of individuals were selected to be
recombinant in the region of a putative QTL on chromosome 3.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ovar
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>cross</code>.  See <code>qtl::read.cross()</code>
for details.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data come from an interspecific Drosophila backcross.  <em>D.
simulans</em> was crossed to <em>D. sechellia</em>, and the <code class="reqn">F_1</code> hybrid
was crossed back to <em>D. simulans</em>.
</p>
<p>The phenotype of interest was ovariole number in females (a measure of
fitness).  Phenotypes <code>on1</code> and <code>on2</code> are the ovariole counts in
the left and right gonads.  The phenotype <code>onm</code> is the average of the
two counts; for many individuals, the ovariole count for one of two gonads
was missing, and so <code>onm</code> is missing.
</p>
<p>In an initial cross of 402 individuals, 383 had complete phenotype data.
Initial genotyping focused on 94 individuals with extreme phenotype.
</p>
<p>To increase the resolution of a major QTL identified on chromosome 3, a
second cross of approximately 7000 flies was performed, though only 1050
individuals showing a recombination event between two morphological markers,
<em>st</em> (bright red eyes) and <em>e</em> (dark brown body), were phenotyped
and genotyped; 1038 had complete phenotype data.  The aim was to oversample
recombinants of the region of the QTL.
</p>
<p>There are genotype data for 24 markers on 3 chromosomes.  (The fourth
chromosome had one marker, but showed no effect and is not included in these
data.)
</p>
<p>The phenotype <code>cross</code> indicates whether an individual came from the
first or second cross.
</p>
<p>Alleles <code>"I"</code> and <code>"E"</code> refer to <em>D. simulans</em> and <em>D.
sechellia</em>, respectively.
