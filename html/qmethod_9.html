<h2>Q methodology: import concourse of Q items</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Imports a full set of items (statements in a concourse) from a directory of *.TEX files (one file per item), including possible translations in separate folders.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">import.q.concourse(q.concourse.dir, languages = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q.concourse.dir</code></td>
<td>

<p>A directory of <em>individual</em> item wordings in *.TEX files with handles as filenames (e.g. <kbd>happy-feeling.tex</kbd>).
If <code>languages</code> are specified, the directory should contain one folder per language, with all full item wordings as individual *.TEX files in <em>each</em> language folder.
Items should have the <em>same</em> file name across all languages (e.g. <kbd>happy-feeling.tex</kbd>).
Directories end with a trailing slash, such as <code>study/q-sample/q-concourse/</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>languages</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character vector of languages, same as folders within <code>q.concourse.dir</code>.
If the concourse is monolingual, leave empty. Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Q studies are conducted by asking participants (or a P set) to rank order a <em>sample</em> (or Q Set) of items, drawn from a universe (or concourse) of items, based on some sampling strategy.
A concourse is, simply put, <em>the sum of all things people could say about a subject matter</em>.
</p>
<p>It is helpful to keep the <em>entire</em> concourse readily available, so as to draw samples from it.
</p>
<p>For some studies, it is necessary to have the complete items available in several languages.
</p>
<p>This function simply imports all full item wordings and assigns a <em>handle</em> for the item, based on the filename (see qmethod-package).
These filenames should be short and meaningful to the researcher.
</p>
<p>Individual items as *.TEX files should include minimal markup, and no trailing whitespace or empty newlines.
If you do not need any additional formatting, you can just save plain text files (*.TXT) with the extension *.TEX.
There is no need to know <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.
</p>
<p>Returns error if items are not available in all translations.
</p>
<p>Defaults to monolingual variant.
</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the terminology of Q item <em>handle</em>, <em>ID</em> and <em>wording</em> or the file structure expected for import functions, please read the respective sections in the documentation for qmethod-package first or consider the package <a href="http://aiorazabala.github.io/qmethod/Data-management">website</a>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a character matrix with handles as row names, languages (if applicable) as columns and full item wording per language in cells.
