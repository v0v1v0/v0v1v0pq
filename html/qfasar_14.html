<h2>Goodness-of-fit for modeled predator signatures</h2>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Diet estimation involves modeling an observed predator fatty acid signature
as a mixture of prey signatures. However, methods to assess how well predator
signatures are modeled have received little attention in the literature
(but see Bromaghin et al. 2015).
</p>
<p>One byproduct of diet estimation is the value of the distance measure that is
minimized during diet estimation (<code>est_diet</code>), called the
objective function. If a predator signature is accurately modeled, the
value of the objective function will be relatively small. Conversely, the
more poorly the signature is approximated, the larger the objective function
will tend to be. However, what value of the objective function to use as a
warning flag for a potentially poor fit is not clear.
</p>
<p>The function <code>gof</code> represents one attempt to answer this question. The
algorithm is based on the following logic. First, we assume that a predator
consumes the mixture of prey specified by its estimated diet composition.
Given that assumption, the expected value of the objective function is, in
a sense, fixed (Bromaghin 2015). Large values of the objective function are
then most likely to occur when variation in a predator signature, which
results from the selection of individual prey within prey types, is
maximized. Within the framework of simulating predator signatures, variation
in the signatures is maximized when the bootstrap sample sizes of the prey
signatures used to construct a predator signature are minimized
(Bromaghin et al. 2016).
</p>
<p>Implementing the above logic, <code>gof</code> randomly samples a single prey
signature from each prey type and weights the resulting signatures with a
predator's estimated diet composition to construct a modeled signature. The
modeled signature is then used to estimate diet. If the optimization function
converges, the value of the objective function obtained with the modeled
signature is compared to the value of the objective function obtained while
estimating diet with the observed signature (argument <code>obj_func</code>. This
is repeated <code>boot_gof</code> times and the proportion of the simulated
objective function values that exceed the observed objective function value
is computed. <code>gof</code> therefore constructs a statistic similar to a
p-value, with small values being suggestive of a predator signature that
was not closely approximated during diet estimation.
</p>
<p>NOTE: the method implemented in <code>gof</code> is at this point only an idea
whose performance has not been explored. It has been included in
<code>qfasar</code> to support future research on this topic.
