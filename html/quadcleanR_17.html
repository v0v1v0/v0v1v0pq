<h2>Sample Annotation Data for Cropping Vignette</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>data_frame</code> that can be used with the Why to Crop Quadrats
by Area vignette to show how quadrat data can be cropped while maintaining spatial
relationships between observations. Data was collected by the
<a href="https://www.juliakbaum.org/">Baum Lab</a> and Kiritimati Field Teams. Data
is the uncleaned version of data found in
Maucieri and Baum 2021. Biological Conservation. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109328">doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109328</a>
The data are from photo quadrats (1m by 1m) which were randomly annotated
with 100 random points each. At each of these annotated points, the substrate
was identified. Photo quadrats were collected on Kiritimati Island in the
Republic of Kiribati and document coral cover over time and space. The
annotations and output of the <code>data_frame</code> were produced using
<a href="https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/">CoralNet</a> and all annotations were done manually,
by trained researchers.
