<h2>Growth curve data on an orthdontic measurement</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Orthodont</code> data frame has 108 rows and 4 columns of the
change in an orthdontic measurement over time for several young subjects.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>distance</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of distances from the pituitary to the
pterygomaxillary fissure (mm).  These distances are measured
on x-ray images of the skull.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of ages of the subject (yr).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>an ordered factor indicating the subject on which the
measurement was made.  The levels are labelled <code>M01</code>
to <code>M16</code> for the males and <code>F01</code> to <code>F13</code> for
the females.  The ordering is by increasing average distance
within sex.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sex</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels
<code>Male</code> and
<code>Female</code> 
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School
followed the growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) from age 8
until age 14.  Every two years they measured the distance between the
pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, two points that are easily
identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.
