<h2>Calculation of the Lambda value</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Lambda value represents the inflation of p-values
compared to a normal distribution of p.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">P_lambda(p)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of p-values</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function removes any missing values from <code>p</code>, and then
returns:
</p>
<p><code>median(qchisq(p, df=1, lower.tail=FALSE)) / qchisq(0.5, 1)</code>
</p>
<p>The lambda value represents the inflation of the p-values
compared to a normal distribution. In a
genome-wide study, one would expect the results for the
vast majority of CpG
sites to accord with the null hypothesis, i.e. the p-values
are random, and have a normal
distribution. Only sites that are significantly associated
with the phenotype of interest should lie outside of the
normal distribution.
</p>
<p>Ideally the lambda value should be 1. Lambda represents the
<em>overall</em> difference with the expected distribution
- so the presence of a few significant results (i.e. p-values
that do not follow the normal distribution) does not bias it.
</p>
<p>However, if lambda is 2 or higher, it means that a
substantial portion of your dataset is more significant than
expected for a genome-wide study (i.e.
oversignificance). This could mean your dataset has been
filtered for low-significance markers. If this is not
the case, you should consider doing a genomic control
correction on the p-values, to correct the oversignificance.
</p>
<p>Similary,
values of 0.8 or lower indicate that your results are less
significant than would be expected from a random distribution
of p-values.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single numeric value, the lambda value.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  pvector &lt;- ppoints(10000)
  P_lambda(pvector)
  # The lambda of a random distribution of p-values equals 1
  
  pvector[pvector &gt; 0.9 &amp; pvector &lt; 0.91] &lt;- NA
  P_lambda(pvector)
  # If low-significance results are removed (i.e. there are more
  # significant results than expected) lambda increases
</code></pre>
