<h2>Pool diet estimates to combined prey types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>diet_pool</code> pools estimated diets and variance matrices to a smaller
number of combined prey types. If <code>est_diet</code> is used to estimate
predator diet composition using a partitioned prey library
(<code>make_prey_part</code>), <code>diet_pool</code> pools the partitioned
results back to the original, unpartitioned prey types.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">diet_pool(rep_grp, est_ind, var_ind = NA, est_mean = NA, var_mean = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rep_grp</code></td>
<td>
<p>The post-multiplication matrix returned by a call to
<code>make_prey_part</code> as the object <code>pool_post</code>, or a
user-defined matrix for custom pooling. Each column defines a prey type
to which estimates should be pooled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>est_ind</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric matrix of the estimated diet compositions of
individual predators using a partitioned prey library, intended to be the
object est_ind returned by a call to <code>est_diet</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_ind</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric array containing the estimated variance matrix for
the estimated diet of each predator, intended to be the object
var_ind returned by a call to <code>est_diet</code>. Optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>est_mean</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric matrix containing the estimated mean diet of each
predator type, intended to be the object est_mean returned by a call to
<code>est_diet</code>. Optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_mean</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric array containing the estimated variance matrix for
the estimated mean diet of each predator type, intended to be the object
var_mean returned by a call to <code>est_diet</code>. Optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>

individual predators.</p>
</dd>
<dt>var_ind</dt>

<p>A numeric array containing the estimated variance matrix for
the estimated mean diet of each predator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>est_mean</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric matrix containing the estimated mean diet of each
predator type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>var_mean</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric array containing the estimated variance matrix
for the estimated mean diet of each predator type.</p>
</dd>
<dt>err_code</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer error code (0 if no error is detected).</p>
</dd>
<dt>err_message</dt>
<dd>
<p>A string containing a brief summary of the results.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>dimac</code> explores the prey library for additional
structure with identified prey types. If significant structure is found
within a library, estimating diet composition on the basis of a
partitioned prey library may lead to estimates with less bias and possibly
less variation through reduced prey confounding (Bromaghin et al. 2016). The
function <code>make_prey_part</code> takes the clustering results returned
by <code>dimac</code> and user specification of the number of clusters in
which to partition each prey type and returns a partitioned prey library
that is ready for use in diet estimation.
</p>
<p>However, when estimating diet composition using a partitioned prey library
one may still wish to pool partitioned estimates back to the original,
unpartitioned prey types for reporting purposes. That is the purpose of the
function <code>diet_pool</code>.
</p>
<p>NOTE: <code>diet_pool</code> can also be used to pool estimates into a smaller
number of combined prey types for reporting purposes. For example, imagine a
prey library with a large number of prey types.  If subsets of the prey
types have similar ecological function, their signatures may share some
similarities (prey confounding, Bromaghin et al. 2016).  In such a case, one
may wish to estimate diet on the basis of the full prey library, but
subsequently pool the resulting estimates to a smaller number of combined
prey types for reporting purposes (reporting groups, Bromaghin 2008) to
reduce the effect of prey confounding. <code>diet_pool</code> can also be used for
this purpose, though the user would need to manually construct the reporting
group matrix <code>rep_grp</code>.
