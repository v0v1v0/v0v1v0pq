<h2>Automobile primer paint thickness quality control measurements.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contains process control measurements of thickness of primer applied to
automotive body parts in an auto factory.
Twice daily, a set of 10 consecutive parts were selected and the thickness in mils (thousandths of an inch)
were measured.  For each set of 10 parts, the average (xbar) and the sample standard deviation (s) were also
calculated and recorded.  These summaries would be plotted in xbar or s control charts with suitably determined upper and
lower control limits.
Alternatively, for checking outliers a qqplot (via qqtest) could be used for either xbar or s.
