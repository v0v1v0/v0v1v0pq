<h2>
Testing Schneider and Wagemann's Theory-Guided/Enhanced Standard Analysis (T/ESA)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This evaluation function can be used to test the implications of Schneider and Wagemann's 
Theory-Guided/Enhanced Standard Analysis (T/ESA; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1065912912468269">Schneider and Wagemann 2013</a>), and in particular, the procedure's first two stages, with respect to the extent of remainders that would have to be declared insufficient for the outcome. It has been programmed for <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpw024">Thiem (2016)</a>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">testTESA(data, outcome = "", neg.out = FALSE, exo.facs = c(""), n.cut = 1, 
         incl.cut1 = 1, incl.cut0 = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataset of bivalent crisp-set factors or bivalent fuzzy-set factors 
or multivalent crisp-set factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the outcome.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>neg.out</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, use negation of <code>outcome</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exo.facs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with the names of the exogenous factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.cut</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum number of cases with set membership score above 0.5 
for an output function value of "0", "1" or "C".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>incl.cut1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum sufficiency inclusion score for an output function 
value of "1".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>incl.cut0</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum sufficiency inclusion score for an output function 
value of "0".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The arguments <code>data</code>, <code>outcome</code>, <code>exo.facs</code>, <code>n.cut</code>, <code>incl.cut1</code> and <code>incl.cut0</code> are those of the <code>eQMC</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the percentages of remainder minterms that would have been used as simplifying assumptions by Quine-McCluskey optimization but that were declared to be insufficient for the outcome by T/ESA.
