<h2>Vickers hardness data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A known chemical company is developing a patent for 
a new variant of artificial stone composed mostly of quartz ( 93wt 
and polyester resin . This company is launching a pilot plant where 
it begins to produce plates of this material to industry scale. In order 
to measure the degree of product homogeneity, 50 samples were taken, 
performed 5 measurements per plate corresponding to different areas 
of artificial stone Vickers hardness
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 250 observations on the following 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>hardness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Vickers hardness corresponding to different
areas of artificial stone</p>
</dd>
<dt>sample</dt>
<dd>
<p>sample id</p>
</dd>
</dl>
