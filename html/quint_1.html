<h2>R package for Qualitative Treatment-Subgroup Interactions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When two treatment alternatives (say A and B) are available  for some problem,
one may be interested in qualitative treatment-subgroup interactions. Such
interactions imply the existence of subgroups of persons (patients) which are
such that in one subgroup Treatment A outperforms Treatment B, whereas the reverse
holds in another subgroup. Obviously, this type of interactions is crucial for
optimal treatment assignment of future patients. Given baseline characteristics and
outcome data from a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), QUalitative INteraction
Trees (QUINT) is a tool to identify subgroups that are involved in meaningful
qualitative treatment-subgroup interactions. The result of QUINT is a tree that
partitions the total group of participants (patients) on the basis of their baseline
characteristics into three subgroups (i.e., partition classes): Subgroup 1: Those for
whom Treatment A is better than Treatment B (P1), Subgroup 2: Those for whom
Treatment B is better than Treatment A (P2), and Subgroup 3: Those for whom it does
not make any difference (P3).

<p>This method is suitable for a continuous outcome variable. From version 1.2 onwards
the baseline variables for growing a tree may have numerical
or integer values (such as continuous, ordinal or dichotomous variables) or may be nominal
(categorical variables with factors). Previously only numerical or dichotomous variables
were supported. Another new feature of this version is that
the output of a <code>quint</code> object can now also display results for either the raw difference
in means or the effect size with corresponding standard error. This depends on the criterion
specified. Furthermore a predict function <code>predict.quint</code> is newly included in this
package. The final new feature is a validate function <code>quint.validate</code> for estimating
the bias (i.e., optimism) of a grown QUINT tree.
</p>
<p>From version 2.0 onwards the qualitative treatment-subgroup interaction is checked during the prune
of the tree and not at the begining of QUINT. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain outcomes
from the summary and predict functions when the tree only contains the root node.
</p>
<p>The core function of the package is <code>quint</code>.
