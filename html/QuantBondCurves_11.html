<h2>Forward curve conversion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a recursive method to calculate the implicit spot rates of
a given forward curve. Calculations and formulas based on the definition of
forward rates where <code class="reqn">\exp{-rT} = \exp{-\int{f(t)dt}}</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fwd2spot(dates, fwd, approximation = "constant")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Term structure of rates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fwd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of forward rates to be converted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>approximation</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that establish the approximation. Set
<code>'linear'</code> for a piecewise linear approximation, or <code>'constant'</code> for a
piecewise constant curve.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Requires continuous rates. Recommended that the input forward curve
starts with maturity 0, if not, function will approximate zero node
as equal to node 1 (first term structure). Output forward
curve slightly differs from empirical curve as it calculates an implicit
forward curve.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Implicit spot curve based on the input forward rates and input term
structure.
</p>
