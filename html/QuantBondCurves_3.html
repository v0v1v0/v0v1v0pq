<h2>Basis Curve</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function that calibrates a "discount basis rate" curve according
to data of cross currency swaps. Available methods are bootstrapping or residual
sum of squares (RSS) between the value of a given or inferred fixed foreign leg
and the value of the local leg.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">basis.curve(
  swaps,
  ex.rate = NULL,
  analysis.date = Sys.Date(),
  rates,
  rates2,
  freq = 1,
  rate.type = 1,
  daycount = "ACT/365",
  npieces = NULL,
  obj = "Price",
  Weights = NULL,
  nsimul = 1,
  piece.term = NULL,
  nodes = seq(0, 15, 0.001),
  approximation = "constant"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>swaps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix containing relevant information of cross currency swaps where each
row represents a swap and each column represents the next attributes: maturity, legs,
coupon rate of local leg, coupon rate of foreign leg, spread of local leg, spread of
variable leg, principal of local and principal of variable leg. <code>colnames(swaps)</code>
must be defined as the following: <code>c("Mat", "Legs", "C1", "C2", "spread1", "spread2", "prin1", "prin2")</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ex.rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Exchange rate on analysis date. Format has to be local currency divided
by foreign currency.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>analysis.date</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date in which the asset is valued. By default, the
current date.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Discount rates given by the local zero coupon rate curve. The curve has to
have nodes with at least, with 3 decimals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rates2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Discount rates given by the foreign zero coupon rate curve. The curve has to
have nodes with at least, with 3 decimals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq</code></td>
<td>
<p>Frequency of payments of a given asset in a year. For LIBOR and
IBR the default frequency is four (quarterly payments). TES has a default
frequency of one (annual payments).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rate.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>(1) for discrete compounded discount rates and (0) for continuosly
compounded discount rates. By default rates are assumed to be discrete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>daycount</code></td>
<td>
<p>Day count convention. See also 'Details'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npieces</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of constant or linear segments for the curve to have. By
default <code>NULL</code>, and bootstrapping method is used, otherwise, minimization of
RSS is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>String related to the definition of the error in the RSS methodology.
Set <code>"Price"</code> for minimization of error by price or <code>"Rate"</code> for
minimization of error by rate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of weights used to dot product with residual squares in order to
calculate residual sum of squares. By default, each residual is assigned the same weight.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsimul</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of simulations for the terms of the pieces. The more simulations,
the more likely to find a better local solution. By default <code>1</code>, and terms are
defined in such way each piece occupies the same length in the abscissa axis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>piece.term</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector that establishes a unique term structure for optimization to take place.
Each piece or segment must have a unique maturity, as numeric value in years,
that signifies the end of the segment. Last segment maturity must not be introduced, it is assumed to be equivalent to
the last term introduced on analysis date. Therefore, the <code>piece.term</code> vector must always have a length equal to <code>npieces</code> - 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Desired output nodes of the curve.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>approximation</code></td>
<td>
<p>String that establish the approximation. Set <code>'linear'</code> for a
linear approximation, or <code>'constant'</code> for a piecewise constant function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
