<h2>Bacteria from Delaware River water entering the Torresdale Filter 
of the Philadelphia water supply 1913.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The number of bacteria per cubic centimetre was measured daily 
for river water entering the Torresdale filter of the Philadelphia
water supply through the whole of 1913.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bacteria
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 22 rows and 2 variates:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>count</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of bacteria per cc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>percentTime</dt>
<dd>
<p>Percent of days (out of 365) having bacteria count 
less than or equal to the measured count.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Rather than the individual daily results, recorded here are 22 values 
together with the percentage of days whose value was less than or equal
to the recorded value.
These quantiles are therefore based on 365 daily measurements.
</p>
<p>Values were taken from a logarithmic-normal probability plot dated 
January 21, 1915 as it appeared in Figure 22 of George C. Whipple's 
1916 (Part 2) paper on the “Element of Chance in Sanitation”.
This paper introduces logarithimic-normal probability paper (or a log-normal qqplot).
</p>
<p><code>with(bacteria, plot(qnorm(percentTime/100), log(count,10), type="o"))</code> 
reproduces Whipple's 1915 plot.
</p>
<p><code>with(bacteria, qqtest(data=count, p=percentTime/100, np=365, dist="log-normal", type="o"))</code>
will effect a qqtest plot for this data.  More detail can be had from:
<code>with(bacteria, qqtest(data=log(count, 10), p=percentTime/100, np=365, dist="normal", type="o"))</code>
</p>
