<h2>Q methodology: sample a Q set from a concourse</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Subsets a concourse of items into a sample of selected items.
Returns a dataframe with handles as row names, and languages (if applicable) as columns.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">build.q.set(q.concourse, q.sample, q.distribution)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q.concourse</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix with handles as row names, (optional) languages as columns, and full item wordings in cells as produced by <code>import.q.concourse</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q.sample</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character vector of handles (such as <kbd>q-is-great</kbd>).
The items identified by the handles will be sampled.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q.distribution</code></td>
<td>

<p>The chosen Q distribution as a vector of integers, such as <code>c(1,3,1)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Q studies are carried out letting participants rank a <em>sample</em> of statements (items), collectively referred to as the <em>Q set</em>.
These Q sets are drawn (by some sampling strategy) from a <em>concourse</em>, or universe of items.
This function subsets the concourse generated by <code>import.q.concourse</code>, based on a vector of handles provided, and returns it as <code>q.set</code>.
</p>
<p>The function implements a number of tests on the validity and consistency of inputs.
</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the terminology of item <em>handle</em>, <em>ID</em> and <em>wording</em> or the file structure expected for import functions, please read the respective sections in the documentation for qmethod-package first or consider the package <a href="http://aiorazabala.github.io/qmethod/Data-management">website</a>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a matrix with handles as row names, languages (if applicable) as column names and full item wordings in cells.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function currently does <em>not</em> actually <em>draw</em> a sample, but merely builds the Q set from a <em>given</em> sample.
</p>
<p>This function currently requires input in the argument <code>q.distribution</code>, but it only checks for the sum, so if you are working with a distribution-free study that still has a fixed number of items, you can just enter a vector of length 1 with your total sum of items.
