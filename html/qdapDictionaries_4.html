Moby project: Moby Part-of-Speech.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(adverb)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector with 13398 elements</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From Grady Ward's Moby project:
"This second edition is a particularly thorough revision of the original Moby
Part-of-Speech. Beyond the fifteen thousand new entries, many thousand more
entries have been scrutinized for correctness and modernity. This is
unquestionably the largest P-O-S list in the world. Note that the many included
phrases means that parsing algorithms can now tokenize in units larger than a
single word, increasing both speed and accuracy."
