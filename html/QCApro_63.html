<h2>Find Superset and Subset Relations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This helper function finds all combinations of conditions among all possible 
combinations that optimize the fulfilment of the specified criteria for a superset (necessity) or subset (sufficiency) relation to the outcome.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">superSubset(data, outcome = "", neg.out = FALSE, exo.facs = c(""), 
            relation = "nec", incl.cut = 1, cov.cut = 0, 
            use.tilde = FALSE, use.letters = FALSE, ...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This helper function to the <code>testTESA</code> function returns a list of those of the 
<code class="reqn">\prod_{j = 1}^{k}{(p_{j} + 1) - 1}</code> 
potential value combinations, where <code class="reqn">p_{j}</code> is the number of values 
for exogenous variable <code class="reqn">j</code> and <code class="reqn">k</code> is the number of exogenous 
variables, that define minimal condition sets for the specified inclusion 
(consistency) and coverage score cut-offs with respect to an outcome.
</p>
<p>If <code>relation = "nec"</code> (default), the function finds (combinations of) 
conditions that are supersets of (necessary for) the outcome. It starts with an 
initiation set, which is comprised of all <code class="reqn">\sum_{j = 1}^{k}{p_{j}}</code> simple 
condition sets. This set is expanded by incrementally forming set-theoretic 
intersections of a higher order as long as <code>incl.cut</code> and <code>cov.cut</code> 
are still met (the former always takes precedence over the latter). If suitable
conjunctions exist, they will be returned, together with all their lower-order
conjuncts.
</p>
<p>If none of the simple conditions or their negations in the initiation set passes 
<code>incl.cut</code>, disjunctions instead of conjunctions are formed until 
<code>incl.cut</code> and <code>cov.cut</code> will have been met. Only the disjunctions thus 
found will be returned.
</p>
<p>If <code>relation = "suf"</code>, the function finds (combinations of) 
conditions that are subsets of (sufficient for) the outcome. The initiation set 
is comprised of all <code class="reqn">\prod_{j = 1}^{k}{p_{j}}</code> 
intersections of order <code class="reqn">k</code>. This set is reduced by incrementally forming 
intersections of a lower order as long as <code>incl.cut</code> and <code>cov.cut</code> are 
still met. Only the intersections of the lowest order will be printed. For more 
details, see Thiem and Dusa (2013). For <code>relation = "necsuf"</code> and 
<code>relation = "sufnec"</code>, <code>incl.cut</code> will be applied to each relation and 
<code>cov.cut</code> has no effect.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>outcome</code> specifies the outcome. Outcomes from multivalent 
variables require curly-bracket notation (<code>X{value}</code>).
</p>
<p>The logical argument <code>neg.out</code> controls whether <code>outcome</code> is to be 
used or its negation. If <code>outcome</code> is from a multivalent crisp-set factor, 
<code>neg.out = TRUE</code> has the effect that the disjunctions of all remaining values 
becomes the new outcome.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>exo.facs</code> specifies the names of the exogenous factors. 
If omitted, all factors in <code>data</code> are used except the factor of which 
<code>outcome</code> is a level.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>use.tilde</code> only applies to bivalent factors. If factors are 
already named with single letters, the argument <code>use.letters</code> has no effect.
</p>
