<h2>Assessment measures of quantile composite-based path modeling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>assessment</code> returns the following measures for assessing both the inner 
and the outer model: communality of each manifest variable, communality of 
each block,redundancy of each manifest variable of endogenous blocks, redundancy 
of the endogenous blocks, and <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code> for each inner equation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">assessment(qcpm)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>is an object of class <code>qcpm</code></p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All the assessment measures discussed in Davino et al. (2016) and Dolce et al. (2021) 
are based on <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code>, proposed by Koenker and Machado (1999), which simulates the 
role and interpretation of the <code class="reqn">R^2</code> in classical regression analysis. The <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code> is 
considered as a local measure of goodness of fit for a particular quantile as it measures 
the contribute of the selected regressors to the explanation of the dependent variable, 
with respect to the trivial model without regressors. In more technical way, <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code>
compares the residual absolute sum of weighted differences using the selected model with 
the total absolute sum of weighted differences using a model with the only intercept. 
The <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code> can be used to assess the inner model measuring the amount of variability of a 
given endogenous construct explained by its explanatory constructs. A synthesis of the 
evaluations regarding the whole inner model can be obtained by the average of all the <code class="reqn">pseudo-R^2</code>. 
Communality indicates how much of the MV variance is explained by the corresponding construct. 
It can be calculated for each MV, and for each block, using the average of MV communalities. 
Redundancy measures the percent of the variance of MVs in an endogenous block that is predicted 
from the explanatory constructs related to the endogenous construct. Redundancy can be computed 
only for each MVs of endogenous blocks and for the whole endogenous blocks, using the average of 
MV redundancies. Results are provided for each quantile of interest. When <code>fix.quantile=TRUE</code>, the 
function returns communalities and redundancies only for the quantile 0.5.
