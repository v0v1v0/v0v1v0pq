Quantification of qualitative survey data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides different functions for quantifying qualitative survey data. It supports the Carlson-Parkin method (developed by Carlson/Parkin (1985)), the regression approach (developed by Pesaran (1984)), the balance approach (see Batchelor (1984)) and the conditional expectations method.
</p>
<p>These methods are usually applied in economics to quantify qualitative inflation expectations collected through surveys (e.g. consumer surveys). However, the same approaches can be used to quantify <em>any</em> qualitative expectation about the change of a variable that is quantitative in nature.
</p>
<p>The four functions of the package – <code>cp</code> for the Carlson-Parkin method, <code>ra</code> for the regression approach, <code>bal</code> for the balance approach and <code>ce</code> for the conditional expectations method – allow the user to customize a wide range of parameters and make use of certain extensions of the original methods. Apart from that all the functions deliver per default two versions of quantified expectations: one under the assumption that the survey respondents form expectations over the <em>absolute</em> change of the variable in question and one under the assumption of expectations over the <em>relative</em> change. The functions also provide the user with standard measures for the forecast quality of the quantified expectations enabling the user to quickly assess the effect of a change in the quantification method used.
