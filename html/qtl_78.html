<h2>Simulated data for an F2 intercross</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data for an F2 intercross, obtained using
<code>sim.cross</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(fake.f2)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>cross</code>.  See <code>read.cross</code>
for details.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are 200 F2 individuals typed at 94 markers, including 3 on the X
chromosome.  There is one quantitative phenotype, along with an
indication of sex (0=female, 1=male) and the direction of the cross (pgm
= paternal grandmother, 0=A, meaning the cross was (AxB)x(AxB), and
1=B, meaning the cross was (AxB)x(BxA)).
</p>
<p>Note that the X chromosome genotypes are coded in a special way (see
<code>read.cross</code>).  For the individuals with pgm=0, sex=0,
1=AA and 2=AB; for individuals with pgm=0, sex=1, 1=A and 2=B
(hemizygous); for individuals with pgm=1, sex=0, 1=BB and 2=AB; for
individuals with pgm=1, sex=1, 1=A and 2=B.  <b>This requires special
care!</b>
</p>
<p>The data were simulated using an additive model with three QTLs on
chromosome 1 (at 30, 50 and 70 cM), one QTL on chromosome 13 (at 30
cM), and one QTL on the X chromosome (at 10 cM).
