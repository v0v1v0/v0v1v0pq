<h2>qqvases: A package for illustrating the construction of QQ plots.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package displays an animation of a normal QQ plot. The animation links points in the
plot to 'water levels' in vases whose shape is defined by probability distributions.
Probability distributions placed along the plot axes gradually fill (become shaded)
as a slider locates larger quantiles of the probability distributions.  The reference
distribution along the x-axis is the normal distribution. 
See the function qq_vase_plot for further information.
