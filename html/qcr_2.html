<h2>Circuit boards data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Number of nonconformities observed in 26 successive samples of 100 printed
circuit boards. Sample 6 and 20 are out of control limits. Sample 6
was examined by a new inspector and he did not recognize several type of
nonconformities that could have been present. Furthermore, the unusually
large number of nonconformities in sample 20 resulted from a temperature
control problem in the wave soldering machine, which was subsequentely
repaired. The last 20 samples are further samples collected on inspection
units (each formed by 100 boards).
