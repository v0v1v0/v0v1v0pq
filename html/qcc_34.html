<h2>Orange juice data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Frozen orange juice concentrate is packed in 6-oz cardboard cans. These cans are formed on a machine by spinning them from cardboard stock and attaching a metal bottom panel. A can is then inspected to determine whether, when filled, the liquid could possible leak either on the side seam or around the bottom joint. If this occurs, a can is considered nonconforming.
The data were collected as 30 samples of 50 cans each at half-hour intervals over a three-shift period in which the machine was in continuous operation.
From sample 15 used a new batch of cardboard stock was punt into production.
Sample 23 was obtained when an inexperienced operator was temporarily assigned to the machine.
After the first 30 samples, a machine adjustment was made. Then further 24 samples were taken from the process.
