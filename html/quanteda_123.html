<h2>Trim a dfm using frequency threshold-based feature selection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a document by feature matrix reduced in size based on
document and term frequency, usually in terms of a minimum frequency, but
may also be in terms of maximum frequencies.  Setting a combination of
minimum and maximum frequencies will select features based on a range.
</p>
<p>Feature selection is implemented by considering features across
all documents, by summing them for term frequency, or counting the
documents in which they occur for document frequency. Rank and quantile
versions of these are also implemented, for taking the first <code class="reqn">n</code>
features in terms of descending order of overall global counts or document
frequencies, or as a quantile of all frequencies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dfm_trim(
  x,
  min_termfreq = NULL,
  max_termfreq = NULL,
  termfreq_type = c("count", "prop", "rank", "quantile"),
  min_docfreq = NULL,
  max_docfreq = NULL,
  docfreq_type = c("count", "prop", "rank", "quantile"),
  sparsity = NULL,
  verbose = quanteda_options("verbose")
)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dfm reduced in features (with the same number of documents)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Trimming a dfm object is an operation based on the <em>values</em>
in the document-feature matrix.  To select subsets of a dfm based on the
features themselves (meaning the feature labels from
<code>featnames()</code>) – such as those matching a regular expression, or
removing features matching a stopword list, use <code>dfm_select()</code>.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dfmat &lt;- dfm(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural))

# keep only words occurring &gt;= 10 times and in &gt;= 2 documents
dfm_trim(dfmat, min_termfreq = 10, min_docfreq = 2)

# keep only words occurring &gt;= 10 times and in at least 0.4 of the documents
dfm_trim(dfmat, min_termfreq = 10, min_docfreq = 0.4, docfreq_type = "prop")

# keep only words occurring &lt;= 10 times and in &lt;=2 documents
dfm_trim(dfmat, max_termfreq = 10, max_docfreq = 2)

# keep only words occurring &lt;= 10 times and in at most 3/4 of the documents
dfm_trim(dfmat, max_termfreq = 10, max_docfreq = 0.75, docfreq_type = "prop")

# keep only words occurring 5 times in 1000, and in 2 of 5 of documents
dfm_trim(dfmat, min_docfreq = 0.4, min_termfreq = 0.005, termfreq_type = "prop")

## Not run: 
# compare to removeSparseTerms from the tm package
