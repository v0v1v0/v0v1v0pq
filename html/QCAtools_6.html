<h2>Convert formula to function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When given a Boolean formula (in disjunctive normal form, see details), this
function produces a function that takes a data.frame of a QCA data
table and computes the fuzzy set score for each case of membership
in the set described by the formula
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">formula_to_function(formula)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string or vector of strings containing a Boolean formula in disjunctive normal form</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Set names must be capitalized in the formula and the data; if they are
lowercase, they are interpreted as the negation of the set.
If <code>formula</code> is a string, logical 'or' is expressed as a '+',
and logical 'and' as a '*'.
If <code>formula</code> is a list of strings, the strings are assumed to be
the dosjuncts and are concatenated with '+'.
Disjunctive normal form means that the formula must be a disjunction of
conjunctions of elementary or negated elementary sets. Example:
<code>A*b*C + a*B</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a function that takes a data.frame and computes the fuzzy set score
of the set described by the formula for each case into a vector
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">formula_to_function("A*b*C + a*B")

</code></pre>
