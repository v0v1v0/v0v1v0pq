<h2>
Transfer alignment from one string to another
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the alignment of linguistic strings, it is often better to perform the alignment on a simplified string. This function allows to pass back the alignment from the simplified string to the original
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pass_align(originals, alignment, sep = " ", in.gap = "-", out.gap = "-")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>originals</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of strings in the original form, with separators
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alignment</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of simplified strings after alignment, with separators and gaps. The number of non-gap parts should match the number of parts of the originals
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>

<p>Symbol used as separator between parts of the strings
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>in.gap</code></td>
<td>

<p>Symbol used as gap indicator in the alignments
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out.gap</code></td>
<td>

<p>Symbol used as gap indicator in the output. This is useful when the gap symbol from the alignments occurs as character in the originals .
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given some strings, a sound (or graphemic) alignment inserts gaps into the strings in such a way as to align the columns between different strings. We assume here an original string that is separated by <code>sep</code> into parts (segments, sounds, tailored grapheme clusters). After simplification (e.g. through <code>tokenize</code>) and alignment (currently using non-R software) a string is retuned with extra <code>gap</code>s inserted. The number of non-gap parts should match the original string.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Vector of original strings with the gaps inserted from the aligned strings.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is a bash-executable distributed with this package (based on the <code>docopt</code> package) that let you use this function directly in a bash-terminal. The easiest way to use this executable is to softlink the executable to some directory in your bash PATH, for example <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or simply <code>~/bin</code>. To softlink the function <code>tokenize</code> to this directory, use something like the following in your bash terminal:
</p>
<p><code>ln -is `Rscript -e 'cat(system.file("exec/pass_align", package="qlcData"))'` ~/bin</code>
</p>
<p>From within R your can also use the following (again, optionally changing the linked-to directory from <code>~/bin</code> to anything more suitable on your system):
</p>
<p><code>file.symlink(system.file("exec/pass_align", package="qlcData"), "~/bin")</code>
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># make some strings with separators
l &lt;- list(letters[1:3], letters[4:7], letters[10:15])
originals &lt;- sapply(l, paste, collapse = " ")
cbind(originals)

# make some alignment
# note that this alignment is non-sensical!
alignment &lt;- c("X - - - X - X", "X X - - - X X", "X X X - X X X")
cbind(alignment)

# match originals to the alignment
transferred &lt;- pass_align(originals, alignment)
cbind(transferred)

# ========

# a slighly more interesting example
# using the bare-bones pairwise alignment from adist()
originals &lt;- c("cute kitten class","utter tentacles")
cbind(originals)

# adist returns strings of pairwise Levenshtein operations
# "I" signals insertion
(levenshtein &lt;- attr(adist(originals, counts = TRUE), "trafos"))

# pass alignments to original strings, show the insertions as "-" gaps
alignment &lt;- c(levenshtein[1,2], levenshtein[2,1])
transferred &lt;- pass_align(originals, alignment, 
    sep = "", in.gap = "I", out.gap = "-")
cbind(transferred)
