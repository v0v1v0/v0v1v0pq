<h2>Mean Change Across Two Timepoints (dependent two-samples t-test)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mean_change</code> tests for mean change across two timepoints with a
dependent two-samples t-test. The function also calculates the descriptive
statistics for the timepoints and the standardized mean difference (i.e.,
Cohen's d) based on either the standard deviation of the pre-timepoint,
pooled standard deviation of the pre-timepoint and post-timepoint, or the
standard deviation of the change score (post - pre). <code>mean_change</code> is
simply a wrapper for <code>t.test</code> plus some extra
calculations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mean_change(
  pre,
  post,
  standardizer = "pre",
  d.ci.type = "unbiased",
  ci.level = 0.95,
  check = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pre</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of the variable at the pre-timepoint.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>post</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of the variable at the post-timepoint. The
elements must correspond to the same cases in <code>pre</code> as pairs by
position. Thus, the length of <code>post</code> must be the same as <code>pre</code>.
Note, missing values in <code>post</code> are expected and handled with listwise
deletion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>standardizer</code></td>
<td>
<p>chararacter vector of length 1 specifying what to use for
standardization when computing the standardized mean difference (i.e.,
Cohen's d). There are three options: 1. "pre" for the standard deviation of
the pre-timepoint, 2. "pooled" for the pooled standard deviation of the
pre-timepoint and post-timepoint, 3. "change" for the standard deviation of
the change score (post - pre). The default is "pre", which I believe makes
the most theoretical sense (see Cumming, 2012); however, "change" is the
traditional choice originally proposed by Jacob Cohen (Cohen, 1988).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d.ci.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of lenth 1 specifying how to compute the
confidence interval (and standard error) of the standardized mean
difference. There are currently two options: 1. "unbiased" which calculates
the unbiased standard error of Cohen's d based on the formulas in
Viechtbauer (2007). If <code>standardizer</code> = "pre" or "pooled", then
equation 36 from Table 2 is used. If <code>standardizer</code> = "change", then
equation 25 from Table 1 is used. A symmetrical confidence interval is then
calculated based on the standard error. 2. "classic" which calculates the
confidence interval of Cohen's d based on the confidence interval of the
mean change itself. The lower and upper confidence bounds are divided by
the <code>standardizer</code>. Technically, this confidence interval is biased
due to not taking into account the uncertainty of the <code>standardizer</code>.
No standard error is calculated for this option and NA is returned for
"d_se" in the return object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ci.level</code></td>
<td>
<p>double vector of length 1 specifying the confidence level.
<code>ci.level</code> must range from 0 to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical vector of length 1 specifying whether the input
arguments should be checked for errors. For example, checking whether
<code>post</code> is the same length as <code>pre</code>. This is a tradeoff between
computational efficiency (FALSE) and more useful error messages (TRUE).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>mean_change</code> calculates the mean change as <code>post</code> - <code>pre</code>
such that increases over time have a positive mean change estimate and
decreases over time have a negative mean change estimate. This would be as if
the post-timepoint was <code>x</code> and the pre-timepoint was <code>y</code> in
<code>t.test(paired = TRUE)</code>.
</p>
