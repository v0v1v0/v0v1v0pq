<h3>Details</h3>

<p>CRAN is a network of servers around the world that store R packages
and their documentation, providing a centralized repository for
the R community. With the current function, users can quickly and
easily determine whether a specific R package has been decommissioned
on CRAN, ensuring they stay informed about the availability and
support status of the packages they rely on for their R
programming projects. This tool simplifies the process of package
management, helping users maintain up-to-date and reliable
dependencies in their R code.

# check if cattonum package is decommissioned
# the current package is expected to be decommissioned
rDecomPkg("cattonum")

# check if dplyr is decommissioned
# the current package is expected NOT to be decommissioned
rDecomPkg("dplyr")

# when a package never existed in CRAN
