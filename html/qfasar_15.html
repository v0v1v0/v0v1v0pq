<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The object passed as the argument <code>sigs</code> is intended to be the signature
object returned by <code>sig_scale</code> or, if the prey library has been
partitioned, by <code>make_prey_part</code>.
</p>
<p>The objects passed as the arguments <code>type</code>, <code>uniq_types</code>,
<code>type_ss</code>, and <code>loc</code> are intended to be the corresponding objects
returned by <code>prep_sig</code> or, if the prey library has been
partitioned, by <code>make_prey_part</code>.
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>dist_meas</code> and <code>gamma</code> must be compatible with the
function <code>dist_between_2_sigs</code>.
</p>
<p><code>lopo</code> performs a leave-one-prey-out analysis with a prey library and
defined prey types (Bromaghin et al. 2016b).  Each signature is
temporarily removed from the library, the mean prey-type signature is
recomputed, and the "diet" of the removed signature is estimated, after which
the removed signature is returned to the library.  This is done for each
signature in turn.  The mean estimate for each prey type is returned as a
row of <code>est</code>.  Perfect estimation would result in the square matrix
<code>est</code> having 1.0 along its diagonal and 0.0 in all off-diagonal
positions.  Large off-diagonal elements are indicative of confounding, or
similarity, between the corresponding prey types.  The returned object
<code>mean_correct</code> is the mean of the diagonal elements of <code>est</code>,
while the returned object <code>total_correct</code> is the mean computed over all
signatures in the prey library.
</p>
<p>Note: the statistics are computed based on the estimates that successfully
converge (<code>n_conv</code>) and prey types that only have a sample size of 1 are
skipped.
</p>
<p>Because of the numerical optimization involved in a leave-one-prey-out
analysis, <code>lopo</code> can take a few minutes to run with a large prey
library.
</p>
<p>The statistics computed by <code>lopo</code> are one measure of the distinctiveness
of prey types within a prey library.  However, it is important to be aware
that such statistics are not necessarily informative of the ability of QFASA
to accurately estimate predator diets, as Bromaghin et al. (2015, 2016a,
2016b) found that QFASA performance depends strongly on the interaction
between characteristics of a prey library, the specific diet of a predator,
and the accuracy of the calibration coefficients.  Consequently, the user is
warned not to misinterpret or misrepresent these statistics.
